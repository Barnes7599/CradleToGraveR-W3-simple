Why Learn R? What are the reasons to learn R for Data Science? In these video tutorials, I will answer all these types of questions.

R is the most popular language in the world for Data Science. It is used in analyzing data that is both structured and unstructured. This has made R, the standard language for performing statistical operations.

I have one simple goal, to create high quality content for R learners. You can learn how to do just about anything online but far too often, the good content is either hidden behind paywalls or buried under hundreds of hours of poorly made content.

I try to make all of my videos and blog posts consistent and well produced. I strive to have great audio and not put in to much fluff.And, as always my videos are created with love.

Every video I create is completely free somewhere on YouTube or the interwebs. Thereâ€™s no premium content, no annoying popups asking you to sign up for our email list, and no shady marketing tactics. What you see is what you get.

What I do have are some Amazon affiliate links and some YouTube ads. I think that keeps the annoyance level way down. 

Enjoy the tutorials!
