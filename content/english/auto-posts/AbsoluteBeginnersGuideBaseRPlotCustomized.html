all right today we’re gonna backtrack just a little bit I’m gonna show you a
couple of basic plots I know we’ve been using ggplot but you’re gonna see other
types of plots so we’re gonna work with base R for now but it’s really quick
this one’s gonna be quick one we’re gonna create the Fibonacci series up to
a couple of numbers anyways and plot them and then I’m gonna show you some
ways to customize your plots real fast so let’s create a fibbin actually
variable and we’ll do that by doing 1 comma 1 comma 3 comma 5 if you’re not
sure what the Fibonacci series is it’s you’re adding the previous two numbers
together 5 plus 3 is 8 8 plus 5 is 13 and so on now this is probably fine for
now so we’ll run that command enter we have our six six numbers in there and
now what I want to do is plot them we use a base R so let’s just plot with the
plot function and we’ll type in fib nothing fancy in there command enter and</p>
<p>00:01
you’ll see down on the right hand side it’s just a pure plot that has one three
six on the x-axis fib on the y-axis and the actual circle little dots now let’s
try to customize this a little bit to suit our needs a little better one of
the first things you might want to do is to add a character string to like the
title you want a title you might want to label the axes a little bit differently
and so let’s just do that it’s a very simple simple method you just add
parameters to your plot so put a comma here and we’ll separate it by a new line
so our main would be our title so our main is this is the Fibonacci fib oh I
might be spawning around but Fibonacci series
that’s our title and if you want to play
around with it you can plot it again and you can see that it added a title and
it’s centered so let’s go ahead and hit comma on that we’re gonna add a subtitle
supposed to sub and we’ll just say something like first six digits</p>
<p>00:02
alright so let’s play around with that where does that go because on the very
bottom there’s all kinds of parameters we can use and I’ll show you just a few
of them the X label is called index let’s call that something different
let’s call that X label equals we’ll just call that the the digit the digit
no keep lowercase is fine why red it will change the Y label equals two oh
you know what we’ll call it index because and then the other one will be
the value at that index so the index one you have one index two you have one
index three you have two and so forth so run that again you can see that I have
all the word index is already in there that’s fine and values on the y-axis
exactly what was expected all right so we can even go even further than that we
can actually change some of the styles of the fonts and things like that so</p>
<p>00:03
let’s keep going down the list and we’re gonna say font of domain equals one and
hit command enter and you’ll see that the font is changed you can try a
different values like number two it made a little bit thicker and so forth now
just play with it for now you can look these up and see what they’ll mean later
but I want to give you a neck the idea that you can change all of this you can
customize all of the plots like this how
thick do we want it so the I figure what CX tents where CX main so let’s do
equals one and you see it’ll change the basically the size of the thickness
let’s do five let’s see if it makes a big difference huge okay so it’s the
size of it right I thought it was thickness for
some reason block we can also change the
font on the axes if we want so like font dot the axes this change that to a bold</p>
<p>00:04
command enter you see that my axes have been bolded and finally let’s change the
label color so the color thought label is equal to blue command up here and you
see that my value index change color the
point is you can customize everything so quick little Stack Overflow search or
Google search on how to change the color of a plot and you are all set now some
of these you’ll memorize pretty we use them all the time let’s not stop
here though let’s change the type of plot that we’re doing here
so more parameters and this is gonna get you know pretty large so you might want
to save this copy-paste for now I’ll show you different ways to do this later
where it’s a lot simpler so we can do the type and do type equals now the
letter L is line so if I hit command and enter on that you’ll see that it’s just
a line so try the line you try B as a line and point so both think of the word
both if you just want point to it be P which is the default anyway so you can</p>
<p>00:05
leave that off s is kind of neat it’s kind of like a staircase this definitely
makes your plots a little bit more aesthetically pleasing see and you can
even change the - it - types n must be none so let’s keep this as being for
both for now and let’s play around some more
parameters so many parameters here it’s ridiculous so it can get a little crazy
so now that we have that let’s change some of the instead of the circles and
the regular DOCSIS change that to something different now there’s like 25
different different plot characters you can use so to do that we would do PCH
PCH plot character equals let’s put a number in there I’ll put the number two
in command enter on that and you’ll see that I got little triangles and then
number three before let’s just pick a random number there’s about 25 of them
so you can pick different characters for</p>
<p>00:06
your little points but we can’t we don’t have to stop there we get we can we can
add more stuff to this let’s say we want to add different types of line types in
general that would be lty line type so L T y equals let’s try start with number
one looks like that’s the default number two and again I watch the show see it’s
a dash line I’ll actually give you a little plot of this in the screen
somewhere and maybe a link to my site we can find this alright so the different
line types different dot types let’s change some of
the other characteristics like comma so this this parameter list is getting
pretty large let’s do color equals blue I’m just
showing you iteratively so we don’t go too far we want to maybe change the size</p>
<p>00:07
of it so the cex let’s make that a 5 manager see my X’s got a lot bigger
I forgot you know I don’t really like X’s so let’s change our where was that
at that is the key character right point character type let’s try it 10 see what
that looks like 10 little circles with crosses in them P
character type line type 3 we still the dashed line and I was trying to let’s
try 5 just before looks like oh no different type of dashed line color goes
blue let’s change the size down to 4 lots of ways to customize this now we
could also change the language lwd equals and let’s make that a six
command enter and you see how thick that is you know obviously you want to
customize this to your liking there are probably hundreds of different ways you</p>
<p>00:08
can customize this you can you can customize it to coordinates so it
doesn’t go through one through six you can go negative five to ten you can
customize even where it starts it doesn’t have to start at one it can
start at three even you can you can keep outliers you can get rid of outliers
there’s all kinds of ways to do this you can actually get rid of the axes you
could pretty much customize this any way you want so you’re going to have to
start googling how to do this if you want very specific things and finally
let’s do one more parameter let’s rotate the AXI text so they’ll say la s equals
one notice on where my values are two four six eight twelve I’m going to
command enter on this and it’s going to rotate my AXI font and text that’s it
so this is just one quick way to customize
a pesar plot without using ggplot2 and make it look pretty make it more
aesthetically appealing so again again if you enjoyed this please share it on
social media like you subscribe do all those things and I will see you in the</p>
