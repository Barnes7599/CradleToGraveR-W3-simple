follow my steps as best you can I would pause this video when you need to
download or install something because I've already done it I'm gonna skip a
lot of that step okay so we're gonna get
out of our and we're gonna run over to a couple of websites the first thing
you're gonna want to do is create a github account so you want to go to
github.com run over there and you'll see
a screen similar to this that's here and just put in a username email and a
password it's free but note this when you do that your username will be
publicly available basically if you're gonna use this to get a job pretend it's
like a LinkedIn account you want to kind of treat it professionally so don't
create a really wacky name unless you're gonna do like a trial name or something
like that make it short readable easy to memorize things like that so just keep
that in mind so let's do a couple of things I'm once you sign up that's it

00:01
just pause for a moment jump over to another website so pause this video for
a moment jump to another website if you have Windows I would use get for Windows
dot org and simply download this get get is a version controller basically a
version control application or system that allows you to keep multiple
multiple versions of the same software in the development lifecycle right damn
I can't talk today but anyways git is just basically a way to keep track of
version control you can merge you can collaborate merge from other
repositories you can branch off and create a whole new repository so if you
have like clones like think of like OBS online broadcast system they have a
another version called stream labs Stream Labs is like a spin-off of OBS so
they branched off of OBS and created their own thing called stream labs but

00:02
you can actually follow that branch all the way up to where it originated so to
speak alright that being said if you have a Mac the alternative would be
right here and you should try git - SCM comm slash download
download that version install it so here we are I'm gonna download this and run
it you'll see alright and also this is as live as I can get today so we'll see
you want to read all of the user agreements click on next this is the
Windows version by the way I know you can't see all these but the default is
fine next next and then right here is what I'm talking about I might be able
to zoom in on this maybe nope I don't know how to zoom in yet but the
middle one is get from the command line and also from third-party software
that's the one that's key crucial because we're gonna use our studio to

00:03
actually push this stuff to get and get is literally just gonna be a placeholder
for us a holder that's it we're not gonna use it for much else yet but I'm
gonna exit this because I've already installed it and I don't want to mess
with all that you want to make sure that when you install it it's gonna ask you
about path variables probably for the novice or the beginner user just go with
the defaults you want your paths to be registered with Windows or Mac whatever
it's going to do that way you can use the command line which we will have to
use in order to push this stuff to get alright so after you've paused this
downloaded what you had to do installed it you've created the github account log
into github and we're gonna start fresh so anybody that hasn't seen the last
couple tutorials I do recommend watching those because they tell you about the
process of how these sites are built and how the layers and the directory
structures work etc etc so be very crucial to do that first my introduction

00:04
all right it still works so my name is Marc Pingris and I basically I teach the
technology that you can use to create content like this in order to publish it
for other people to learn from it sounds like a lot but it's really not it's
basically I have two channels this is the art channel and then I have one that
teaches me how how you create these videos and make money online so check
them both out I'm going to log in here into github and you'll see
maybe a similar screen but what you want to look for is the repositories you
might have this screen or a different screen but you want to look for the
repositories and click on new we're gonna create all of this from scratch if
you have an existent project I might show you how to do that later I did
actually achieve that so that's possible as well but this is the easiest route
for the first time alright let's get right to it let's call this one hour
whatever you want to call it let's call it um project one simple enough
whatever want to call it I'm gonna leave description blank you can fill it in if

00:05
you like you can also if you pay for the service you can have a private but it's
all gonna be public and for the free version so I'd probably stick with
public for now and initialize this repository with a readme alright and so
create repository and you'll see you not a whole Lots gonna be done there's a
couple of things here that's about it what you want to do is you want to go to
clone or download which is right here I'm waving my mouse and click on that
little paperclip or copy that URL I know you can't see it completely because I'm
in the way but just copy that URL right here completely and let's go to our
studio we're gonna create a brand new project so file new project and this
time we're gonna go to version control and get now if you've installed get like
like you just should have a few minutes ago and you didn't restart your are you
might not have this option so just remember if this doesn't work right away

00:06
just restart our real quick and do it like by hitting the X don't just hit the
session restart session actually close our open it back up then you know then
you'll have this good option actually you might have this option but you might
not get to this screen right here now paste that URL that you just grabbed in
there and you'll see that my project 1 are automatically appeared that means
that it actually did reach out to that website that quickly and pulled in my
project name and of course put your browser to wherever you want to store
this particular project we have a blank project here and it's gonna just do its
thing it's gonna set up its get it's gonna create a couple of hidden folders
I'll show you those in all right so right now don't do anything
yet let's go to get tab which is up here and you should have that because you've
installed get and restarted our and we're gonna stage stage both of these
files the dot get ignore and the project
one dot are proj we're just gonna see if

00:07
this works and then you can move forward so staging it you see that little
checkbox you should be able to click staged and staged and then so it's
staged it's getting ready to do something what are we gonna do with it
we're gonna commit it as in we're committing this code we trust it we know
it works so let's click on this little commit button here done deal you see
it's turn green here you want to commit message you have to have a message so
this is my first commit testing whatever
you want to call it but you have to have
that because every version of this every time you commit that code if you made
some changes you might want to document what those changes are so you can you
know again get well-well-well version control every single change you
make you can go back a thousand versions and it's fine right so let's go ahead
and click on commit then you will see something pop up here and then the close
button right no errors just hit close and then you're gonna want to hit push

00:08
and when push happens all right so here's a couple caveats now you might be
lost right now you might be lost because something might have popped up saying
there was an error I want to go over a couple more things to things so mine
worked fine don't worry if yours didn't work yet I'm sorry I forgot to show you
a step that I've already done so what you want to do is you want to set up
your git well you might have had a pop-up to say what's your user name and
password that might have solved your problem if it did not go to shell or
tools shell it should open up to that project directory that you're on it
doesn't really matter for this but what you want to do you want to set up your
email address and your user name basically so I'm gonna just go ahead and
type in and I'll do it again so get space config space dash dash
global space username and then in quotes you want to put your username and my

00:09
username is MT Greengrass you get that from your github which you've just
created so right here you can see my username is MT gin grass right here so
let's go back to this I'm gonna go ahead and hit enter
I got no errors so please if you did get an error I hope you pressed on and saw
this message here and let's do this again I'm gonna hit the up arrow instead
of repeating all that I just hit the up arrow like are you can do instead of
username I'm gonna call this a reading user email user dot email and that's the
actual email address you use to create your github account and that's for me
mark dot Jen grass at gmail.com feel free to contact me if you want I guess
oops let me delete all this stuff boom alright we made it this far huh I feel
like I should edit this piece and put it to this side I probably will alright

00:10
close that now we're good now if your are now when you go to commit and do all
that stuff it should work it should work from this point if it did not work try
there's a couple things you can try I'm not going to give you all the
troubleshooting techniques but go to the directory where your project is so in
mine its site test project one so this is where I created the directory you
will probably not see the dot git or the dot our project user until you click on
view this is all windows-based so Mac you've got to kind of extend this
to a Mac and it should be fine I have filename extensions checked and hidden
items so on a Mac you'd want to make sure your hidden items are viewable
alright so under get you would have a lot of files here you'd have one called
index dot lock sometimes if you're stuck as frozen you might delete index dot
lock this one is not it's just plain to index all right I'll leave the

00:11
troubleshooting alone right now I'm hoping that we're all on the same page
again make sure that you do that get command where you put your username and
password or username and email in there all right we have nothing on this
project we haven't done anything yet so let's create that blog down site how do
we do that now we do blog down : : new site right so this is from scratch theme
equals and pick your theme from the hugo themes and i think that was called gz g
CU s h en hugo academic i believe that's what it was you could pick a theme
anywhere you want just look up hugo blog down themes or
something and the github name of that person and the theme is the format so
the author of the github page and then the theme so it's doing its thing it's

00:12
creating the directories it's creating everything it needs in order to render a
website right and it's shows the website
here on the bottom left or right and I'm up here now but I'm not gonna stay up
there alright so the websites there we could see it everything's work and one
thing that you might want to try to do before you do anything is stop the
server we've created the website now let's build the website let me jump back
in here alright so we do have the server running you can see to run to stop the
server you can type in this so that's what I'll do I'll just copy paste that I
don't want the server to be running hit enter okay
stopped now let's build the site so blog down : : hugo build and that's it so
let's run this I know it seems like a lot of steps but it's honestly gonna
save you a lot of time in the end all right that was quick and easy it built

00:13
it again it's not gonna look like you want yet we're just trying to push stuff
to github that's it alright so we built the site I'm gonna just go ahead and
save this you can see I've got hello our markdown free to go man you know that
was prior to build any but we built it so that created all the public
stuff now the problem is with git and our studio when there's a lot of files
it tends to crash a lot so remember how we staged that dot get ignore in that
other file if I try to stage this public
folder I've done this like six times now it crashed every single time so I'm not
even gonna try it again but you can click on it and try to click that little
stage button right here I don't think you should though but you can give it a
shot maybe it's just my configuration what we're gonna do instead is go to the
shell again so tools shell and I wish I knew how to do it by a directory so make

00:14
sure you're in the directory of your project which you should be and let's
see there's a couple of commands that you'd want to use I think oh yeah I know
what it is get a space add okay add now the subfolder is called public PU BL IC
I'm gonna put that and then I'll put the star in there why not so we're doing
this with a command line we're staging it looked like it worked there's a
couple of warnings in there but it has nothing to do with what we're doing so
now that they're all staged let's alright so are caught up let me
see if you can see me still yeah so are actually put those checkmarks in there
again you could try to check public and it'll maybe work but it crashed on me
six times in a row so I'm staged all of this stuff is now public I'm going to
now commit all of the staged work that I've done which was basically press a
few buttons so commit now in the commit you can see that my staged stuff is

00:15
still to the left and that's all my public stuff that's all I care about
setting it up to github because we're going to use github literally just for
like a holding area for an it low fee later commit message first commit test
for tutorial you want to put this message out there because you might have
twenty five thirty five different versions and you can kind of just revert
back based on that message maybe right so click on commit
and close and then push pushes the final thing it's gonna push it to your github
account in fact I'll show you now before I click it let's go to my github I'm in
my project one I can even refresh it you could see what we staged before the
initial commit and the project but now we're going to commit the rest I'm going
to click on push I'm gonna push I know it seems like a lot and I you're
probably run into some issues I think I covered most of them I'm gonna hit the X

00:16
on that now refresh you see that public folder right there we did it the public
folder is there we have everything in public now this index dot HTML is not
going to work the way you suspect because it's literally just gonna be the
code but don't worry about that so I don't know if we want to reiterate so we
have github create an account download get for Windows org or this get SCM -
comm slash downloads download that for Mac go back to our studio create a new
project which is a version controlled project not a directory click on version
control paste that URL that you got from github from that new repository and
it'll automatically plug in your title basically it's a project create it stage
your dot ignore and your project file commit those two files push those two

00:17
files again if you didn't set up your Pat your email and your username using
the shell go back and check out how I just did that
so you might want to do that first all right and then you would create the blog
down site I would take off Surfside I would run that demon killer whatever it
was build the Hugo site then I would stage all of the public using the shell
not our studio so all right well that's a lot for one little go so call this one
quits I'm sorry that it's a little bit confusing but if you follow closely I
think you'll get there let me know in the comments if this was
just really confusing and you want me to do another run at it I can do that if
you have any troubles let me know if it works for you also please subscribe and
share like I do have a discord page as well I'm gonna try to grow that

00:18
community so please and thank you for all the help you guys have done for me
so far just by contributing with the comments and likes [Music]End of file
