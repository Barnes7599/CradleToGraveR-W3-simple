one on this site because time is ticking
so I’ve changed the theme real quick of my art studio if you’re not sure how to
do that you can go to tools global options sorry I’m jumping right into it
appearance and then you can pick your fonts and all that I was not happy with
my font I like the dark theme but I don’t think recording it is the best for
the viewer I’m not sure you guys can leave me feedback on the comments and
that’d be great tell me if you like the darker theme or
the lighter theme better for viewing I don’t know if you’re looking at this on
a phone or a tablet or what but hopefully you guys can all see it I have
the font pretty high mostly for you and because I’m getting old in my eyes can’t
see anyways so that being said let’s talk more about this blog down and Hugo
site I didn’t do much I literally just read a couple pages and changed one
thing but I want to show you a couple of couple of important aspects of the
site’s let’s go back to files here and make sure that you’re in that project</p>
<p>00:01
there’s only this is only tutorial number three for the Hugo blog down site
so if you’re if you’re not caught up just go back and check them out that
being said let’s go open up this config T oml file it should be in your
directory so and what happens is you have this site here your base URL is
going to be the URL that you’re going to eventually use don’t be don’t worry if
you don’t have one already I do I own cradle-to-grave
our comm don’t really use it yet but that’s why I’m building this site I want
to be able to offer code on there and advice and just you know pull people to
the site so I need to get one set up don’t look now because it’s actually I
mean you can but it’s a wordpress site so we’re gonna migrate that alright so a
lot of these are self-explanatory base URL that’s where you gonna put it
now if you want a truly free you can get free URLs from like github or get labs
or things like that and you’ll have like whatever site you want dot github or
something com right but let’s not worry about that yet we’re not there yet</p>
<p>00:02
alright so going down what’s your language of choice for the
code and your default content language English English for me then the title
would be website of whatever your name is let’s go with mark
Jim grass and I want to show you a couple more things here theme I don’t
know what that is yet so don’t I don’t know what that is there’s no point in me
trying to explain that one summary length I believe that when you summarize
it’s how many lines before it goes through like I read more we can look all
this stuff up later and enable emojis true okay cool
discuss discuss short name so it’s a static site generator but if you have a
discuss account which is free dia SC us si is qus com
you can apply for a site and it’ll actually allow you to have comments on
the bottom of all your posts so you can actually keep track of comments people
just log in with like one button and you’d put that short name which disgust
will give you right here in Hugo and blog down will do the rest</p>
<p>00:03
no worries same thing with Google Analytics and now we have some
parameters here these are the parameters that you have like on our website like
the title the author description etc etc I exchanged my profile picture just now
I just random I picked one but images forward slash mark profile dot PNG and
I’ll show you where that is if you open up your actual site mine was called test
seven so open up test seven that’s my actual project name again I said don’t
mess with public don’t so what’s gonna happen probably if you don’t pay too
much attention is you’re gonna want to make changes you think you’re you’ve got
it figured out you’re gonna go to public and you can start making changes and
then when you go to re-render this on are you gonna overwrite that public
folder in fact I’ll show you how to override that public folder right now
immediately so let’s go over here where my face is and you can see I have a
couple of options here I’ve built website and I have more let’s click on
more and click on clean all now before I do that again I showed you I have a</p>
<p>00:04
public site here clean all I’m gonna click it I’ll save my file and let’s go
to here again test seven top quick I still have public well that did not do
as I wanted it to warned in Europe and ignore certain files no that’s fine let
me try it from here real quick build clean all I might be just going too fast
for my own oh well that works so it’s gone now
I wasn’t going crazy it did work you know what’s funny is I got these
shortcuts for my OBS and it changes when I type a man it does stuff too
to my icons at least I didn’t delete anything so anyway so there’s no public
folder that’s what I’m trying to get at fine and dandy
let’s see also if you happen to get the public folder let’s do that let’s build
so I’m gonna click on build website again I’ll do it up here so you can see</p>
<p>00:05
me install and restart hmmm actually let me see if there’s a different option
here build website save selected and exit with one status that’s normally not
good oh here we go so my hotkeys that killed me again line
20 I have a plus and a minus those are my shortcut keys I’ve ctrl Alt + + - 4
shortcut keys now save it and build website the struggle is real so it’s
built and now it’s going to open up in the actual our studio viewer and you can
see that it’s not looking good right don’t worry about that yet you’re also
gonna notice when you go to your public folder which you’re not supposed to go
to click there go to index you can pull it right over you will notice that it
also does not look good that’s because these sites require a server so we now</p>
<p>00:06
have a simulated server by doing surf site so would you blog down serve site
and I’ve showed you this but I’m just kind of trying to give you some more
lingo of what’s going on now you see in the viewer it actually served it
correctly but also also I did surf site where did I do surf site I was already
serving it and so I don’t have the IP address offhand so let’s just do you
don’t have to do this unless you don’t have the IP address blog down stop
server and then surf site so it’ll give me this IP address right here and you
can just copy that IP address and put it in your browser
I believe I’ve already shown you this let me pull a browser over and show you
it copied it and will paste it right in and now it’s showing up the correct way
you can have links working the links are
definitely working on here you can click on the post you can see the different
stuff in the post you can see my squashed out weird-looking picture so
yeah it’s all there you can leave this up if you want make changes or not the</p>
<p>00:07
images are under let me show you a couple things about the directory
structure so on test seven it don’t mess
with public but if you go to static this is what you might want to store your
images there under images so mine is called mark profile P entry caps do
matter so you’ve got to get that right and if you make it relative versus
absolute which absolute would be you know this entire path so you drive users
mark don’t make anything absolute just make it relative and that means for here
you just need to put hey my base directory slash
images slash mark profile they it’ll always start at the base directory so
that makes it a lot easier let’s move down a little bit so that’s how I got my
picture changed I just literally just type mark profile instead of the profile
dot jpg that was there so main sections post scroll down a little bit I don’t
the math settings it’ll it’ll do late a cork a tech so what have you want to</p>
<p>00:08
call it mathjax so you can actually have
mathematical let’s see if I can show you one here probably not because I’m there
I wonder yeah so you could see if I scroll down there should be some math in
here somewhere well even if there’s no I think you
understand what I’m talking about math should work in there if not we’ll
troubleshoot it later okay so it looks like social icons icon FA LinkedIn so it
looks like LinkedIn here’s the title and you can put your own LinkedIn URL in
there so whatever that might be I think I could probably pull mine up I don’t
use a very I don’t use it very often so I think my LinkedIn is called
linkedin.com slash maybe my name let’s see nope
well figure that one out later too but I wanted to show you you can put your URL</p>
<p>00:09
there and you will I’m sure after this video
same thing with github or anything you want and if you want to add more you
know you can just kind of see how this pattern is so just copy all of this you
can put in say Etsy or something so you put an icon that you like whatever icon
you can download it doesn’t have to be anything fancy and in the title and then
the actual website it’s that simple and so let me see if I could find it on the
actual page so it looks like right here these are where it’s at so LinkedIn
github Instagram and Mail so it’s all right there very simple and that’s what
these links are here simple as that menu items so the menu items are going
to be let me pull it up again at the top you have home posts and about but
they’re not dropdowns there any things so let’s see if I click on posts or</p>
<p>00:10
about yeah there’s no drop-down so it’s not too fancy so we should be able to
easily figure this one out we can make them fancy I’m sure but looks like you
have some sort of main menu and menu domain so follow the pattern you can get
you can get the idea you know cuz we just saw home we saw a post and we saw
about here’s the idea of how to do that and the weight is probably the position
of where it’s at so 100 200 300 is my guess so how far apart you want them to
be from probably a starting point and that’s it for the tomah file for now
there’s tons of options you can put in here you might see some stuff relative
URLs equals true things like that but for now keep it like this and just I
wanted to show you that it wouldn’t work
if you go to the public folder and check it out because you’re not serving the
site you have to serve the site so what we’re gonna do next is we’re going to
create a not in this video but in the next one we’re gonna create a github
account and a net low fee account and we’re going to try to put this on the
web and then we’re going to use our which is right here and we’re actually</p>
<p>00:11
going to have a button up here soon enough that you click one button and so when
make your changes you click your button that’ll commit your code to github and
then net lovely net Liffey is going to monitor github folders and when it
changes it’ll update the site and you can actually set that up to be your own
domain name not a given domain name but if you want truly free you have to take
the one they give you basically probably somewhat customizable but having like a
net low fee or github extension of some sort but so you could play around with
all that stuff in there I will show you a couple more things but not too deep
here though let’s go back to test seven this is
where my project is under content public
static and so under public we never mess with remember because it’s gonna be
generated and rendered and it’s going to change every single time you make
changes and build your site themes when you do want to play off of the themes to
make changes to your themes you would have to mess with this and we’ll get</p>
<p>00:12
into that later on but for now we’ll leave the theme that we built it
originally with and so under content let’s double check here we have posts
don’t worry about that but the static is important under static you have posts
and images so what you have is under post is but well I could be I am
definitely wrong on that I’m trying to find something I think it may be under
content hmm I was looking for maybe ten of themes ah it’s under themes sorry so
it’s been a long time I played with this a long time ago got it all work
now I’m redoing it I’m talking like a year and a half two years ago so under
themes this is where something’s important but not today we’re not gonna
go there today but under layouts you’re gonna have different things called</p>
<p>00:13
default and partials and so a default is hey a single HTML page is going to look
like this it’s gonna have a pattern to it a single list a list of like here’s
my list of blogs do I want 10 or 20 to want it to look like this or that so
those are the things you can play with eventually and partials is the same
thing if I when I header or a footer how do I want all of them to look and so
when Hugo and blog down are rendering all of this stuff it takes those themes
and those layouts and says this is how they want every single page to look and
it builds it for us so don’t get too far into that yet unless you know a little
bit more about the structure of a hugo site and the HTML underlying it and it’s
not just HTML it’s actually the hugo i guess standard language to use you’ll
see some weird crazy brackets and stuff like that but that’s it I wanted to show
you that and don’t forget if you restart your are you’re serving your site will
go away and just always remember that your links and stuff will be broken
until you serve that site so don’t get too alarmed about that so play around</p>
<p>00:14
get these set up to be your parameters maybe add a menu item or add a link and
let’s see what you come up with and in the next video I think we’ll create the
other sites so just wanted to give you one quick update have a good oneEnd of file</p>
