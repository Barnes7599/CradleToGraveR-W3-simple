all right today we are gonna do linear simple linear regression and it's a
straight forward approach to predict in a a quantitative response variable like
Y on the basis of a single predictor variable like X and remember the capital
y and the capital X is like a random variable so it could mean all kinds of
things capital X and capital y in statistics typically mean a random
variable so it could be any number it's not quite the same as a regular variable
that you learn in algebra so we're gonna assume because we're gonna take this
approach and say we're gonna do a linear
relationship so we're gonna see if there is a linear relationship between a
predictor and a response variable and so mathematically we want to write this
down as capital y capital y is approximately so that's the approximate
symbol and then we're going to use a term called beta zero which is basically

00:01
our y-intercept and I'll show you this here in a second two plus a beta 1 times
your X variable now these are capitalized the x and y because that
variable is a random variable we don't know what it is right we're assuming
that it could be any random variable because we don't know we're trying to
fit a formula to our data that's the goal now we're going to call these
coefficients of the parameters now this one here doesn't really have anything
except for itself connected to it that's not connected to the random variable so
this is like a free parameter where you would estimate this and you would
estimate this to get the best value when
you plug in that random variable you get
a best value for Y that's actually close to the real value right
so in our Cova analysis example this might be the death the the number of
deaths so the number of deaths whoops is equal to some initial condition

00:02
coefficient plus some other coefficient times the number of cases right so this
might be cases so beta 1 times the number of cases plus some initial
condition equals the number of deaths again these model coefficients are
sometimes parameters as well and once we find once
we have the data we can start estimating what this wire really is so this wire
right here in this equation it's a true Y this is the Y we want in real life but
as you see the approximate symbol here so this y is approximately this formula
right we don't know the formula because we don't know what our betas are right
but there's still that's a very valid y the true Y is approximately this so if
we want to start estimating that Y we would start using lowercase and we put a
little hat on there say hey an estimate for that true value of y the estimate of
that Y is actually equal to because it as an estimate I can't I don't have to

00:03
use approximate anymore I'm creating I'm creating an estimate out of the data
points so because it's an estimate I put
the hat on there but it's truly equal to
now we're going to use theta naught with a hat on so an estimate for beta naught
plus an estimate for beta 1 times an X variable okay so the Y hat indicates a
prediction of Y the actual Y on the basis of we're saying that this X
happens to equal that little X so when this big x this big x could be a bunch
of random numbers it's whatever we remember it can be we're saying hey of
all the random numbers in the world we choose the random number called X and
that's why it's here now it's it's subtle and it's just notation so don't
get too caught up with it but I wanted to give you that to start our linear
regression process so how do we graph something like this I want to bring you

00:04
back just a couple years to basic graphing of a y equals MX plus B type
equation because you'll notice this is kind of like a y equals MX plus B
equation I'll show you that in just a moment let's let's move this over here
and I'll create a new one so we had a Y well we have the y hat is equal to the
beta naught hat plus beta naught or beta 1 hat times some variable
this is our estimate for the true value of y it's an exact equation because we
have the equal sign there but because you have the hat on there means hey
that's a estimate for the y value the true value right so that reminds me of
back in algebra when you have the original equation y equals MX plus B and
remember when you graph this equation here there's a couple of rules you can
go by so let's just go ahead and create a equation where I know the slope and I

00:05
know the B and we'll graph it real quick so let's just pretend this was y is
equal to 2x plus 3 now how do you graph this well we have the coordinate system
here I just randomly created it focus in on the first quadrant
according 1 2 3 4 but we're gonna be focusing on the first quadrant so y
equals 2x plus 3 let's label our axes so you have an X and a Y and what we're
gonna say is hey when x is 0 when you put a 0 in there when that's possible 0
times 2 is 0 plus 3 is 3 so therefore Y is equal to 3 when x is 0 so down to 0
when X is here the Y value is here we know for a fact we have a point right
here on this coordinate system so we got that figured out now what's our slope
the slope is 2 X the slope is always the M value and what is the M value well
it's the one that's connected to the predictor variable the X so it's always
connected to the X in this in this example so what's our M value well it's

00:06
that two so there's our 2 and remember M
is equal to slope which is equal to rise over run which is equal to in this case
we know that our rise over run and our M is equal to 2 so solve for this well 2
is the same thing as 2 over 1 because 2 divided by 1 is 2 so I rise must equal 2
an hour run must equal 1 so let's rise to 1/2 when I go up 2 and then over 1
and that's how you do it I'm sure you all remember this but the refresher
probably couldn't hurt and so you have a
you have a line to points make a line no matter what you can go down to left 1
down to left one and go up to right one it
doesn't matter because remember negative two divided by negative one is equal to
two as well you're not making a change to the equation but that's not that
important what's important is that you understand how this kind of graphs
because what we're gonna do next is we're gonna have some random dots on the
page and we're gonna say well what's the

00:07
best fit here so it's important that you kind of understand the language of
mathematics and formulas before you start using R to actually do the
predictive analysis for you now don't get me wrong you won't need to know all
of this but you need to kind of understand the big picture of what it's
trying to get at so hope you enjoy it and again please share this video if you
