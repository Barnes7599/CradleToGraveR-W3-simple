hello my name is Martin Jen grass in this tutorial I'm going to assume that
you've already installed our and our studio this particular series of
tutorials is going to cater to those that have somewhat of a smidgen of
programming experience already so I will go slightly faster than I would if
you've never programmed in your life that in said you don't have to have
actually had programming experience to follow along but a little bit of math
knowledge or just some logic will get you through that being said once you
open up your art studio after installing
the software you're gonna come up with a
screen that looks just like this and you have a console area which is on the
left-hand side and you have a blinking cursor with a little greater than symbol
that's where you're going to input your actual code and then on the right hand

00:01
side at the top typically you'll have your environment my environment isn't
empty I'm not storing anything and that's where you store your variables if I
declared a variable X equal to five it'll be stored in my global
environments list and on the bottom right we have a bunch of different tabs
and it's usually on the package or files
tab by default and what you have here is
also plots so you'll find various things
down here in the bottom right that we'll use throughout the tutorials that being
said let's jump right to it this little console right here we're going to type
in some basic calculations like two plus four that equals six we all know that
now that little line that little number with a 1 in it that's that's saying hey
line one of your output is equal to six basically and and this will do more
complex math like two times three plus eight and it does obviously do the math
order of operations you can do exponents two to the fourth

00:02
you can also do trig functions like pi divided by two and it's in radians by
default you can do things like four and you can do three point four and it
should give you back three so basic math operations come straight out of the box
as expected now we don't really want to work in the console window because the
console window is kind of like your stove you put it on the stove it's gonna
start cooking we want more of a recipe and that recipe is what we're gonna call
in our script so we store recipes in filing cabinets or in a recipe book we
write it down and we don't actually cook anything until we actually take the
ingredients and put them on the stove so that being said let's learn how to
create our first our script we want to go to file new file our script when we
create the script it's called untitled one by default and you don't have to

00:03
save it at this point but it's obviously good practice to save as you go now
scripts offer the simplest form of repeatable analysis in our they're just
like text files that contain code and comments and the extension is dot
capital R so your brand new script is completely empty the first few things
you want to put in any our script should be to have good program practice is to
put comments in it and you can put comments in like this is my first
program and now you comment is that little pound symbol the hash tag and
anything to the right of that hash tag will not be executed when you run the
script now on the left hand side you see the line numbers and you all obviously
you might have a different theme than I have I have a dark theme with purple if
you want to change that let's go ahead and go to view I'm sorry let's go to

00:04
tools global options and then you'll see appearance down here and what I'm gonna
do to make this easier to record is I'm gonna increase the font size to
something more manageable for for you all to see on the screen and then you'll
see all kinds of different editor themes and as you go through them you can see
there's different themes now if we're recording this video I think I'm going to
switch it to something a little bit lighter let's just go with textmate
defaults and we'll go with that now you can pick whatever theme you like wow I'm
not used to bright like that anyways line five we're gonna do something
simple just like we did with the console we're gonna do two plus two we're gonna
hit the enter button and you'll notice nothing happens if you notice down at
the very bottom we do have a console still there you see the console tab and
a few other tabs you can actually change this as well to to view more or less of

00:05
the console what we want to do is we want to execute this within our script
what we can do on a Mac is you can hold command and hit the return key and
you'll see it appear down here at the console and whenever I use the word
command it's usually an ad analogous with control so control enter if you're
on a PC with Windows okay but two plus two doesn't do anything but print to the
console the number four what if we want to assign that to a variable let's
assign that to a variable X X and you will see this notation I have here the
less than symbol then a little dash that is saying hey assign what's on the
right-hand side of this to the left-hand side so the evaluated to plus two which
is equal to four is going to be assigned to X but not yet because I didn't hit
command return on it yet now I just did you see in my global environments X on
the left and four on the right it is in my global environment so now wherever I
choose to within this project area even in the console if I type in X what's

00:06
going to appear the number four and up here if I hit little X again and I
actually run it it's going to be equal to four as well so let's pretend that
this is our entire script ins can do something magnificent we're gonna save
the world with this script we want to save it so let's go to save and we'll
just pick a spot I'm gonna do save as and I'm gonna save it in just on my
desktop is fine for now I'm gonna call it test program you can call it whatever
you choose you'll see that it changed the test
program our that our extension now to run this entire script I'm literally
just gonna hit this little Run button here and you can see there's a little
command return here that also works but if I click on run it'll just run that
line so it does is it's a sign-in X it is a sign to two plus two if I hit run I
hit run again it's gonna just print X see how that works but I've actually

00:07
highlighted Oh it'll do both hello so let's change that so I can prove it to
you so let's make that a 5 right now I do not execute line 5 notice this if I
hit command return on line 6 it still shows 4 also if I hit this Run button on
line 6 it still shows 4 but now if I highlight the whole thing or even the
entire program because as I said lines 1
2 &amp; 3 are commented out they will not
execute now if I click run it'll run all the lines that are highlighted and
you'll see the number 7 show up in my console just like that and you can do
things like Y is equal to I'm sorry y is assigned to X plus 4 so we have X
we would think that it's equal to 7 because that's what X is in our global
environment here take that 7 add 4 to it and assign it to Y I'm gonna do command
enter for the most part when I'm showing

00:08
you the examples now you have y and X in our environment now these two variables
x and y they remain in memory so that means it's in your RAM it's very easily
accessible we can reuse these objects until we close our so this will get you
started on your very first our script after the script I'm going to show you
how to do markdown which is even more awesome than an our script
so this is your taste of what an our script is an our script is good for very
simple analyses maybe some simple basic things but now if you want to actually
publish this into a journal or share it with colleagues or have some really good
documentation with like an introduction you want our methods of use methods of
analysis you want to put a conclusion in there etc etc you want to be able to
reproduce these results and explain it to anybody well an our script isn't

00:09
necessarily the best method for that in the next video I'm going to show you how
to do an r markdown file and I think you're gonna really appreciate the power
of our markdowns and our notebooks I hope this video was useful and if it was
leave a comment below let me know how and also subscribe that'll help me grow
my channel and continue creating videos like thisEnd of file
