00:00
so in the last tutorial I talked about how to make a dynamic string so that we
can get the Cova 19 or the coronavirus data from the European CDC daily
automatically well our pattern turned out to not be foolproof so we're gonna
fix that in this quick tutorial and then we'll go on to a few other things to
clean it up a little bit let me explain to you what's going on so we had system
data in here because the date changed now if you go to the actual CDC for the
European CDC site you would see publications and data and you'll find
the data right here easily accessible so if you right click on it and you go to
copy link address what we're gonna notice is if I paste it down here it's
already pasted actually I paste it down here a letter for letter it's the same
as what URL 1 would be except for it's got an X at the end of the extinction

00:01
and our previous one did not so this is a really good example of real world data
and how it you know the stuff you have to deal with no kiddin but this is not
it so let me walk walk you through the other problems and we'll add on a little
bit more to this tutorial so let's add that X in there
that's fine but now I read excel function still our read excel function
will only work for the XLS extension and not xlsx so let's change that function
to read underscore xlsx so read underscore X LS X now it should work so
now I can run this chunk and it's gonna use the system data as always and it
should run so let's go ahead and run that simple as that so if you watch the
previous tutorial that no longer applies
you have to update it to this now let me
show you where the next problem is I did
notice something but I'm not sure why it still worked with this dot XLS function
here so I the way it works so let's just keep it that way for now now we go down

00:02
to some and we're gonna sum all the new deaths you're gonna find that this does
not work huh I'm confused oh it does not work it
didn't give an error but it gives a warning so if you look at this it says
unknown or uninitialized column there is no column called new deaths anymore how
do we know that well let's figure that out as we troubleshoot this I'm hungry
I'm gonna go down to the console here and let's do names and they just type in
DF so it's gonna give us all the column names and you'll see I have 1 through 7
and I have no new deaths I have deaths that change the names of
the features of the of the columns so we have to fix that so to fix that we can
get rid of the word new rerun this and we should be fine now that being said
what let's let's not weren't really cleaning up the data we're just
exploring the data so let's change this to Cove aid Explorer something like that

00:03
and we're gonna run this chunk first and then underneath this chunk I'm actually
gonna do some narrative and say there are or there have been and now instead
of not assigning this to a variable let's do that let's just call it
Kovach death total and then we can run it so we can actually store that into a
variable you see it over here in our environment so there have been and then
we can do a back tic that's the letter to the left of the one not the quote
type in the letter R to say hey I'm gonna insert a little bit of our code
inside of my narrative and the code I want to insert after I've run it above
is the actual death rate so kovat death total tactic to close it you see it
turns a different color so there have been blank death sense and then we can
add backtick R we're going to we're going to use the our language and we're

00:04
going to use sysdate open parentheses close parentheses and then we'll add a
period so now we have that you can't see those totals right now because we
haven't rendered this yet what you could do is you can copy this you could paste
it down here and kind of get an idea ok 7103 what's the system date you do the
same and kind of see what its gonna look like
when it is rendered all right so we've got that figured out
let's scroll down a little bit further to our we have no other header here but
we can call this well we're just getting the death rate
so right here we group by country exposed we don't have that anymore remember
the names were changed so let's go ahead and do that let's actually talk about
those names in our narrative and say the features we have are and then I'll name

00:05
them right so I will do backtick our space names of what's in that data frame
backtick now we have the names now what are they well we can do it again down
here names no problem yes so we know that country expose is no longer there
but countries and territories is so let's go ahead and just change these up
so we have a working program again countries and territories notice the
back ticks because there's spaces inside of this feature or a variable named
mutate is when you're gonna create a brand new variable that's not in the
data set so you're gonna mutate the data set into adding something else so we're
gonna call that something else death rate we're going to set it equal to the
sum of all you're gonna see that this isn't the best way to do it but we take
the sum of all the new confirmed cases but again they've changed the name now
this is a real-life business problem that we have the business unit decided
to rename it because it's more aesthetically pleasing but it breaks all
of your programming so that's why you have to keep the transparency in the

00:06
communication between the business unit and the developers the statisticians
etcetera etcetera so let's call this cases because that's what it's called
now and then again there's no such thing
as new deaths it's just called deaths so now we should be good we can hit the
play button here and we have our data frame now let me show you when we render
this that it's going to add this data to our rendered file
so our markdown render and then we're just going to type in
I in quotes script one RMD because that's what this is called
hit enter should have no issues you'll see script 1 NB notebook dot HTML so
click on it view and web browser what do
we have so we have Kovac cases in our we
have our hey this is where we're getting our data from we should probably date
this somehow but the number of deaths we
have some code here we can hide the code if we like we can not hide it here some

00:07
of our stats the number of deaths in 2000 since this date is 7103 so it's
getting up there and then here's the actual data that if somebody wanted to
and what will change how this looks later on in other tutorials but I want
to show you one other thing before we call this one quits let's go back to our
R and you'll notice that some of this code wasn't there so like this actually
this code was here library HTT R let's see show all code well it's not showing
that code all right so let's click on this little gear box and see these
little custom settings here I think we can either click them to the right or
left it's actually changed since last time I played with this don't want to do
that so let's put these all to the right never show all code let's just try it
and I believe which would be good so click down on the console up arrow or

00:08
repeat the last command and let's see if that worked open in web browser we do
not have the code oh it's all fun and games until it doesn't work the way you
want oh I've got to save it ctrl command
s then render common mistake I do it all the time
and I just I'm glad that I made this mistake cuz you're probably gonna make
the same mistake if you don't save it before you render it it won't make the
changes so now you see the code and the message here but let's say you didn't
want the code you can just do include equals false I'm really glad I made that
mistake because I do it all the time I'll make changes on the actual editor
and then I'll render it again but it's gonna read it's going to
only render the lace the last saved version of it so you have to save your
work before you render again let's put this because this code here isn't
actually telling us anything about our our our data it's just kind of prepping

00:09
things so let's do include equals false on this command s and then we can render
it and you'll see that that code is no longer there so let's try this one more
time view in web browser the code should
be gone so you want to kind of keep this I would recommend kind of in between
like a little bit of code when it's necessary but if you're going to show
this to the business unit maybe just a description of what's going on on where
you got your data from things like that and here we go so we've got to cleaned
up just a little bit I wanted to fix those mistakes from yesterday there
weren't mistakes it's just the CDC site has actually changed and hopefully
tomorrow it works but if not then we have to go to fix our code again so
let's just call this one quits and I will see you guys in the very next tutorial
