welcome back to day two of the blog slash our markdown our studio Hugo
blogged down whatever you want to call it I want to do a couple things with you
today knowing that everything is not perfect because that’s what we’re kind
of run into is just not perfect situations from last time we created a
site sort of and it showed up in our viewer down here you can see down here I
don’t have anything right now but we didn’t really expand on too much further
than that so let’s let’s go ahead and create a brand new site in fact so this
is basically live I’ve ran into some problems earlier so I could probably
walk through most of this but let’s do a
new project to start on the same page so let’s just do that so create a new
directory we can try using the blog down</p>
<p>00:01
web site here you know I just don’t want you to get used to always having these
you know easy answers right so but let’s just do it anyway so I’m gonna add a
directory called I don’t know test seven I don’t how many tests I have out there
so test seven and that’s I’ve got it under another directory site test pay
attention to the check marks here install Hugo Hugo automatically add
sample blog post I want all this because I’m new right
keep empty directories I don’t look the default happen for now but now it says
convert all metadata to llamo I’m no no I’m gonna not check that off
because all right I like you Amal you had another markdown language but a lot
of the tutorials out there are in Tamil whatever that stands for writes OTO ml I
wanted to keep it told well let’s see if it works
we’ll just go from there now add the example site of the theme and I have
this theme here right it’s the Hugo lithium but it’s under yih UI Hugo</p>
<p>00:02
lithium let me give you a hint these themes are pretty cool that you can do
this this is the author of the theme and then this is the name of theme if we go
to a website and I have don’t I haven’t tested this yet so we’re
gonna test it right now together I’m gonna bring this over here and okay so
this is the themes doc go Hugo dot IO I’m gonna literally just pick a random
theme something simple I hope how about this let’s go to clean and let’s just
click oh man I don’t know I’m Jane Doe right here that’s clean what I’m trying
to figure out is how do you install this
I think you would do see if I got a home
page yeah yeah okay this is exactly what I’m looking for
whew the home page should be a github page and you can see I’ve got the author</p>
<p>00:03
and the name of it right here so let’s copy and paste that you can’t even see
my keyboard let’s copy and paste that in here
right and get rid of that backslash and it should work remember I unchecked
convert to llamo let’s see if it works sorry I went kind of a long winded way
to get there but I wanted to show you that you can put different themes in now
okay we’ve got this thing built here now you if you don’t I don’t know if I
already talked about this but if you don’t have this build option or this
build option over here you should because you’ve just created this website
with the blog down website like creator right if you don’t all you have to do is
restart your computer and it should or not your computer restart our studio and
it should come up and if it doesn’t then you might want to step back and see if
you did something wrong so that should be there with a restart of your art
studio and then once you have the build you can build it and do all these things</p>
<p>00:04
what I want to show you there was a couple things all right so we we have
this we have no idea what it is we’re just gonna serve this site we’re gonna
say blog down : : site serve wait yeah serve site serve site I think I’m a
little backwards today cool it shows up down here just like they should click on
posts and everything works okay here’s some posts rich content okay so the post
work I like it now there’s going to be issues actually before the issues let’s
read this notice here to stop the server run server daemon stop one or restart
your our session right so we can do restart our session it’s fine now we
could find this here this little IP address useful so ctrl C on that bad boy</p>
<p>00:05
there and let’s go to an actual blank tab and paste that in there and
everything seems to be working just fine if I click on anything it should work
cool we can hit go back I think using that and we’re back to square one that’s
what I wanted to show you sort of now let’s I’m gonna put this over here to
the right and I’m gonna put this window to the left what I want to show you is
how to change some of this on the fly so if I want to change markdown syntax
guide which I can find in my files here you should be able to go to remember
stay away from public don’t mess with that yet go to content and then it
should be under your post and under the post markdown syntax guide that’s just a
title don’t forget so I’m guessing it’s markdown - syntax MD now you could
probably see it on the very bottom of my screen it’s very small</p>
<p>00:06
it says markdown syntax so that’s the one we want markdown syntax so now you
see that here right it’s got the author it’s got all kinds of HTML stuff going
on all kind of stuff what I want to do is I want to change the name of it
instead of markdown syntax guide I’m gonna call it I’ll just call that mark
gin grass that’s my name so and then ctrl s and you’ll see that it didn’t
change over here you might have to hit refresh right you click refresh and it
changed that’s fine normally you’re not going to have to hit
refresh for most of your changes that’s what I wanted to show you so let’s try
it now I’m just going to use my last name I’m gonna do control s and you see how
it automatically updated so you need to kind of kick it in gear by doing the
refresh once and then it seems to work so that’s really what I wanted to show
you was some of these things that you can do on the fly and you got to figure
out how to install different various themes be careful with the themes not
everything is going to be treated equally and in another tutorial after</p>
<p>00:07
this we’ll discuss some more problems that I have please if you enjoy this
tutorial try to share it and like it send me some comments especially I have
a feeling that we’re gonna run into some weird issues and I want to know what
they are see if I can help you with in the comment system on YouTube or
whatever this is posted on okay well I hope that helps a little bit with some
of your issues and give you some options on themes so have fun playing around
you [Music]End of file</p>

wanted to keep it told well let’s see if it works
we’ll just go from there now add the example site of the theme and I have
this theme here right it’s the Hugo lithium but it’s under yih UI Hugo</p>
<p>00:02
lithium let me give you a hint these themes are pretty cool that you can do
this this is the author of the theme and then this is the name of theme if we go
to a website and I have don’t I haven’t tested this yet so we’re
gonna test it right now together I’m gonna bring this over here and okay so
this is the themes doc go Hugo dot IO I’m gonna literally just pick a random
theme something simple I hope how about this let’s go to clean and let’s just
click oh man I don’t know I’m Jane Doe right here that’s clean what I’m trying
to figure out is how do you install this
I think you would do see if I got a home
page yeah yeah okay this is exactly what I’m looking for
whew the home page should be a github page and you can see I’ve got the author</p>
<p>00:03
and the name of it right here so let’s copy and paste that you can’t even see
my keyboard let’s copy and paste that in here
right and get rid of that backslash and it should work remember I unchecked
convert to llamo let’s see if it works sorry I went kind of a long winded way
to get there but I wanted to show you that you can put different themes in now
okay we’ve got this thing built here now you if you don’t I don’t know if I
already talked about this but if you don’t have this build option or this
build option over here you should because you’ve just created this website
with the blog down website like creator right if you don’t all you have to do is
restart your computer and it should or not your computer restart our studio and
it should come up and if it doesn’t then you might want to step back and see if
you did something wrong so that should be there with a restart of your art
studio and then once you have the build you can build it and do all these things</p>
<p>00:04
what I want to show you there was a couple things all right so we we have
this we have no idea what it is we’re just gonna serve this site we’re gonna
say blog down : : site serve wait yeah serve site serve site I think I’m a
little backwards today cool it shows up down here just like they should click on
posts and everything works okay here’s some posts rich content okay so the post
work I like it now there’s going to be issues actually before the issues let’s
read this notice here to stop the server run server daemon stop one or restart
your our session right so we can do restart our session it’s fine now we
could find this here this little IP address useful so ctrl C on that bad boy</p>
<p>00:05
there and let’s go to an actual blank tab and paste that in there and
everything seems to be working just fine if I click on anything it should work
cool we can hit go back I think using that and we’re back to square one that’s
what I wanted to show you sort of now let’s I’m gonna put this over here to
the right and I’m gonna put this window to the left what I want to show you is
how to change some of this on the fly so if I want to change markdown syntax
guide which I can find in my files here you should be able to go to remember
stay away from public don’t mess with that yet go to content and then it
should be under your post and under the post markdown syntax guide that’s just a
title don’t forget so I’m guessing it’s markdown - syntax MD now you could
probably see it on the very bottom of my screen it’s very small</p>
<p>00:06
it says markdown syntax so that’s the one we want markdown syntax so now you
see that here right it’s got the author it’s got all kinds of HTML stuff going
on all kind of stuff what I want to do is I want to change the name of it
instead of markdown syntax guide I’m gonna call it I’ll just call that mark
gin grass that’s my name so and then ctrl s and you’ll see that it didn’t
change over here you might have to hit refresh right you click refresh and it
changed that’s fine normally you’re not going to have to hit
refresh for most of your changes that’s what I wanted to show you so let’s try
it now I’m just going to use my last name I’m gonna do control s and you see how
it automatically updated so you need to kind of kick it in gear by doing the
refresh once and then it seems to work so that’s really what I wanted to show
you was some of these things that you can do on the fly and you got to figure
out how to install different various themes be careful with the themes not
everything is going to be treated equally and in another tutorial after</p>
<p>00:07
this we’ll discuss some more problems that I have please if you enjoy this
tutorial try to share it and like it send me some comments especially I have
a feeling that we’re gonna run into some weird issues and I want to know what
they are see if I can help you with in the comment system on YouTube or
whatever this is posted on okay well I hope that helps a little bit with some
of your issues and give you some options on themes so have fun playing around
you [Music]End of file</p>

welcome back to day two of the blog slash our markdown our studio Hugo
blogged down whatever you want to call it I want to do a couple things with you
today knowing that everything is not perfect because that’s what we’re kind
of run into is just not perfect situations from last time we created a
site sort of and it showed up in our viewer down here you can see down here I
don’t have anything right now but we didn’t really expand on too much further
than that so let’s let’s go ahead and create a brand new site in fact so this
is basically live I’ve ran into some problems earlier so I could probably
walk through most of this but let’s do a
new project to start on the same page so let’s just do that so create a new
directory we can try using the blog down</p>
<p>00:01
web site here you know I just don’t want you to get used to always having these
you know easy answers right so but let’s just do it anyway so I’m gonna add a
directory called I don’t know test seven I don’t how many tests I have out there
so test seven and that’s I’ve got it under another directory site test pay
attention to the check marks here install Hugo Hugo automatically add
sample blog post I want all this because I’m new right
keep empty directories I don’t look the default happen for now but now it says
convert all metadata to llamo I’m no no I’m gonna not check that off
because all right I like you Amal you had another markdown language but a lot

this we have no idea what it is we’re just gonna serve this site we’re gonna
say blog down : : site serve wait yeah serve site serve site I think I’m a
little backwards today cool it shows up down here just like they should click on
posts and everything works okay here’s some posts rich content okay so the post
work I like it now there’s going to be issues actually before the issues let’s
read this notice here to stop the server run server daemon stop one or restart
your our session right so we can do restart our session it’s fine now we
could find this here this little IP address useful so ctrl C on that bad boy</p>
<p>00:05
there and let’s go to an actual blank tab and paste that in there and
everything seems to be working just fine if I click on anything it should work
cool we can hit go back I think using that and we’re back to square one that’s
what I wanted to show you sort of now let’s I’m gonna put this over here to
the right and I’m gonna put this window to the left what I want to show you is
how to change some of this on the fly so if I want to change markdown syntax
guide which I can find in my files here you should be able to go to remember
stay away from public don’t mess with that yet go to content and then it
should be under your post and under the post markdown syntax guide that’s just a
title don’t forget so I’m guessing it’s markdown - syntax MD now you could
probably see it on the very bottom of my screen it’s very small</p>
<p>00:06
it says markdown syntax so that’s the one we want markdown syntax so now you
see that here right it’s got the author it’s got all kinds of HTML stuff going
on all kind of stuff what I want to do is I want to change the name of it
instead of markdown syntax guide I’m gonna call it I’ll just call that mark
gin grass that’s my name so and then ctrl s and you’ll see that it didn’t
change over here you might have to hit refresh right you click refresh and it
changed that’s fine normally you’re not going to have to hit
refresh for most of your changes that’s what I wanted to show you so let’s try
it now I’m just going to use my last name I’m gonna do control s and you see how
it automatically updated so you need to kind of kick it in gear by doing the
refresh once and then it seems to work so that’s really what I wanted to show
you was some of these things that you can do on the fly and you got to figure
out how to install different various themes be careful with the themes not
everything is going to be treated equally and in another tutorial after</p>
<p>00:07
this we’ll discuss some more problems that I have please if you enjoy this
tutorial try to share it and like it send me some comments especially I have
a feeling that we’re gonna run into some weird issues and I want to know what
they are see if I can help you with in the comment system on YouTube or
whatever this is posted on okay well I hope that helps a little bit with some
of your issues and give you some options on themes so have fun playing around
you [Music]End of file</p>

welcome back to day two of the blog slash our markdown our studio Hugo
blogged down whatever you want to call it I want to do a couple things with you
today knowing that everything is not perfect because that’s what we’re kind
of run into is just not perfect situations from last time we created a
site sort of and it showed up in our viewer down here you can see down here I
don’t have anything right now but we didn’t really expand on too much further
than that so let’s let’s go ahead and create a brand new site in fact so this
is basically live I’ve ran into some problems earlier so I could probably
walk through most of this but let’s do a
new project to start on the same page so let’s just do that so create a new
directory we can try using the blog down</p>
<p>00:01
web site here you know I just don’t want you to get used to always having these
you know easy answers right so but let’s just do it anyway so I’m gonna add a
directory called I don’t know test seven I don’t how many tests I have out there
so test seven and that’s I’ve got it under another directory site test pay
attention to the check marks here install Hugo Hugo automatically add
sample blog post I want all this because I’m new right
keep empty directories I don’t look the default happen for now but now it says
convert all metadata to llamo I’m no no I’m gonna not check that off
because all right I like you Amal you had another markdown language but a lot
of the tutorials out there are in Tamil whatever that stands for writes OTO ml I
wanted to keep it told well let’s see if it works
we’ll just go from there now add the example site of the theme and I have
this theme here right it’s the Hugo lithium but it’s under yih UI Hugo</p>
<p>00:02
lithium let me give you a hint these themes are pretty cool that you can do
this this is the author of the theme and then this is the name of theme if we go
to a website and I have don’t I haven’t tested this yet so we’re
gonna test it right now together I’m gonna bring this over here and okay so
this is the themes doc go Hugo dot IO I’m gonna literally just pick a random
theme something simple I hope how about this let’s go to clean and let’s just
click oh man I don’t know I’m Jane Doe right here that’s clean what I’m trying
to figure out is how do you install this
I think you would do see if I got a home
page yeah yeah okay this is exactly what I’m looking for
whew the home page should be a github page and you can see I’ve got the author</p>
<p>00:03
and the name of it right here so let’s copy and paste that you can’t even see
my keyboard let’s copy and paste that in here
right and get rid of that backslash and it should work remember I unchecked
convert to llamo let’s see if it works sorry I went kind of a long winded way
to get there but I wanted to show you that you can put different themes in now
okay we’ve got this thing built here now you if you don’t I don’t know if I
already talked about this but if you don’t have this build option or this
build option over here you should because you’ve just created this website
with the blog down website like creator right if you don’t all you have to do is
restart your computer and it should or not your computer restart our studio and
it should come up and if it doesn’t then you might want to step back and see if
you did something wrong so that should be there with a restart of your art
studio and then once you have the build you can build it and do all these things</p>
<p>00:04
what I want to show you there was a couple things all right so we we have

it automatically updated so you need to kind of kick it in gear by doing the
refresh once and then it seems to work so that’s really what I wanted to show
you was some of these things that you can do on the fly and you got to figure
out how to install different various themes be careful with the themes not
everything is going to be treated equally and in another tutorial after</p>
<p>00:07
this we’ll discuss some more problems that I have please if you enjoy this
tutorial try to share it and like it send me some comments especially I have
a feeling that we’re gonna run into some weird issues and I want to know what
they are see if I can help you with in the comment system on YouTube or
whatever this is posted on okay well I hope that helps a little bit with some
of your issues and give you some options on themes so have fun playing around

welcome back to day two of the blog slash our markdown our studio Hugo
blogged down whatever you want to call it I want to do a couple things with you
today knowing that everything is not perfect because that’s what we’re kind
of run into is just not perfect situations from last time we created a
site sort of and it showed up in our viewer down here you can see down here I
don’t have anything right now but we didn’t really expand on too much further
than that so let’s let’s go ahead and create a brand new site in fact so this
is basically live I’ve ran into some problems earlier so I could probably
walk through most of this but let’s do a
new project to start on the same page so let’s just do that so create a new
directory we can try using the blog down</p>
<p>00:01
web site here you know I just don’t want you to get used to always having these
you know easy answers right so but let’s just do it anyway so I’m gonna add a
directory called I don’t know test seven I don’t how many tests I have out there
so test seven and that’s I’ve got it under another directory site test pay
attention to the check marks here install Hugo Hugo automatically add
sample blog post I want all this because I’m new right
keep empty directories I don’t look the default happen for now but now it says
convert all metadata to llamo I’m no no I’m gonna not check that off
because all right I like you Amal you had another markdown language but a lot
of the tutorials out there are in Tamil whatever that stands for writes OTO ml I
wanted to keep it told well let’s see if it works
we’ll just go from there now add the example site of the theme and I have
this theme here right it’s the Hugo lithium but it’s under yih UI Hugo</p>
<p>00:02
lithium let me give you a hint these themes are pretty cool that you can do
this this is the author of the theme and then this is the name of theme if we go
to a website and I have don’t I haven’t tested this yet so we’re
gonna test it right now together I’m gonna bring this over here and okay so
this is the themes doc go Hugo dot IO I’m gonna literally just pick a random
theme something simple I hope how about this let’s go to clean and let’s just
click oh man I don’t know I’m Jane Doe right here that’s clean what I’m trying
to figure out is how do you install this
I think you would do see if I got a home
page yeah yeah okay this is exactly what I’m looking for
whew the home page should be a github page and you can see I’ve got the author</p>
<p>00:03
and the name of it right here so let’s copy and paste that you can’t even see
my keyboard let’s copy and paste that in here
right and get rid of that backslash and it should work remember I unchecked
convert to llamo let’s see if it works sorry I went kind of a long winded way
to get there but I wanted to show you that you can put different themes in now
okay we’ve got this thing built here now you if you don’t I don’t know if I
already talked about this but if you don’t have this build option or this
build option over here you should because you’ve just created this website
with the blog down website like creator right if you don’t all you have to do is
restart your computer and it should or not your computer restart our studio and
it should come up and if it doesn’t then you might want to step back and see if
you did something wrong so that should be there with a restart of your art
studio and then once you have the build you can build it and do all these things</p>
<p>00:04
what I want to show you there was a couple things all right so we we have
this we have no idea what it is we’re just gonna serve this site we’re gonna
say blog down : : site serve wait yeah serve site serve site I think I’m a
little backwards today cool it shows up down here just like they should click on
posts and everything works okay here’s some posts rich content okay so the post
work I like it now there’s going to be issues actually before the issues let’s
read this notice here to stop the server run server daemon stop one or restart
your our session right so we can do restart our session it’s fine now we
could find this here this little IP address useful so ctrl C on that bad boy</p>
<p>00:05
there and let’s go to an actual blank tab and paste that in there and
everything seems to be working just fine if I click on anything it should work
cool we can hit go back I think using that and we’re back to square one that’s
what I wanted to show you sort of now let’s I’m gonna put this over here to
the right and I’m gonna put this window to the left what I want to show you is
how to change some of this on the fly so if I want to change markdown syntax
guide which I can find in my files here you should be able to go to remember
stay away from public don’t mess with that yet go to content and then it
should be under your post and under the post markdown syntax guide that’s just a
title don’t forget so I’m guessing it’s markdown - syntax MD now you could
probably see it on the very bottom of my screen it’s very small</p>
<p>00:06
it says markdown syntax so that’s the one we want markdown syntax so now you
see that here right it’s got the author it’s got all kinds of HTML stuff going
on all kind of stuff what I want to do is I want to change the name of it
instead of markdown syntax guide I’m gonna call it I’ll just call that mark
gin grass that’s my name so and then ctrl s and you’ll see that it didn’t
change over here you might have to hit refresh right you click refresh and it
changed that’s fine normally you’re not going to have to hit
refresh for most of your changes that’s what I wanted to show you so let’s try
it now I’m just going to use my last name I’m gonna do control s and you see how
it automatically updated so you need to kind of kick it in gear by doing the

you know easy answers right so but let’s just do it anyway so I’m gonna add a
directory called I don’t know test seven I don’t how many tests I have out there
so test seven and that’s I’ve got it under another directory site test pay
attention to the check marks here install Hugo Hugo automatically add
sample blog post I want all this because I’m new right
keep empty directories I don’t look the default happen for now but now it says
convert all metadata to llamo I’m no no I’m gonna not check that off
because all right I like you Amal you had another markdown language but a lot
of the tutorials out there are in Tamil whatever that stands for writes OTO ml I
wanted to keep it told well let’s see if it works
we’ll just go from there now add the example site of the theme and I have
this theme here right it’s the Hugo lithium but it’s under yih UI Hugo</p>
<p>00:02
lithium let me give you a hint these themes are pretty cool that you can do
this this is the author of the theme and then this is the name of theme if we go
to a website and I have don’t I haven’t tested this yet so we’re
gonna test it right now together I’m gonna bring this over here and okay so
this is the themes doc go Hugo dot IO I’m gonna literally just pick a random
theme something simple I hope how about this let’s go to clean and let’s just
click oh man I don’t know I’m Jane Doe right here that’s clean what I’m trying
to figure out is how do you install this
I think you would do see if I got a home
page yeah yeah okay this is exactly what I’m looking for
whew the home page should be a github page and you can see I’ve got the author</p>
<p>00:03
and the name of it right here so let’s copy and paste that you can’t even see
my keyboard let’s copy and paste that in here
right and get rid of that backslash and it should work remember I unchecked
convert to llamo let’s see if it works sorry I went kind of a long winded way
to get there but I wanted to show you that you can put different themes in now
okay we’ve got this thing built here now you if you don’t I don’t know if I
already talked about this but if you don’t have this build option or this
build option over here you should because you’ve just created this website
with the blog down website like creator right if you don’t all you have to do is
restart your computer and it should or not your computer restart our studio and
it should come up and if it doesn’t then you might want to step back and see if
you did something wrong so that should be there with a restart of your art
studio and then once you have the build you can build it and do all these things</p>
<p>00:04
what I want to show you there was a couple things all right so we we have
this we have no idea what it is we’re just gonna serve this site we’re gonna
say blog down : : site serve wait yeah serve site serve site I think I’m a
little backwards today cool it shows up down here just like they should click on
posts and everything works okay here’s some posts rich content okay so the post
work I like it now there’s going to be issues actually before the issues let’s
read this notice here to stop the server run server daemon stop one or restart
your our session right so we can do restart our session it’s fine now we
could find this here this little IP address useful so ctrl C on that bad boy</p>
<p>00:05
there and let’s go to an actual blank tab and paste that in there and
everything seems to be working just fine if I click on anything it should work
cool we can hit go back I think using that and we’re back to square one that’s
what I wanted to show you sort of now let’s I’m gonna put this over here to
the right and I’m gonna put this window to the left what I want to show you is
how to change some of this on the fly so if I want to change markdown syntax
guide which I can find in my files here you should be able to go to remember
stay away from public don’t mess with that yet go to content and then it
should be under your post and under the post markdown syntax guide that’s just a
title don’t forget so I’m guessing it’s markdown - syntax MD now you could
probably see it on the very bottom of my screen it’s very small</p>
<p>00:06
it says markdown syntax so that’s the one we want markdown syntax so now you
see that here right it’s got the author it’s got all kinds of HTML stuff going
on all kind of stuff what I want to do is I want to change the name of it
instead of markdown syntax guide I’m gonna call it I’ll just call that mark
gin grass that’s my name so and then ctrl s and you’ll see that it didn’t
change over here you might have to hit refresh right you click refresh and it
changed that’s fine normally you’re not going to have to hit
refresh for most of your changes that’s what I wanted to show you so let’s try
it now I’m just going to use my last name I’m gonna do control s and you see how
it automatically updated so you need to kind of kick it in gear by doing the
refresh once and then it seems to work so that’s really what I wanted to show
you was some of these things that you can do on the fly and you got to figure
out how to install different various themes be careful with the themes not
everything is going to be treated equally and in another tutorial after</p>
<p>00:07
this we’ll discuss some more problems that I have please if you enjoy this
tutorial try to share it and like it send me some comments especially I have
a feeling that we’re gonna run into some weird issues and I want to know what
they are see if I can help you with in the comment system on YouTube or
whatever this is posted on okay well I hope that helps a little bit with some
of your issues and give you some options on themes so have fun playing around
you [Music]End of file</p>

welcome back to day two of the blog slash our markdown our studio Hugo
blogged down whatever you want to call it I want to do a couple things with you
today knowing that everything is not perfect because that’s what we’re kind
of run into is just not perfect situations from last time we created a
site sort of and it showed up in our viewer down here you can see down here I
don’t have anything right now but we didn’t really expand on too much further
than that so let’s let’s go ahead and create a brand new site in fact so this
is basically live I’ve ran into some problems earlier so I could probably
walk through most of this but let’s do a
new project to start on the same page so let’s just do that so create a new
directory we can try using the blog down</p>
<p>00:01
