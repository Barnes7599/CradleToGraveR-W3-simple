welcome back everybody I promised that I
would show you in our notebook which is an awesome awesome thing it's better
than an RMD file it's an actual notebook file which will actually carry over the
code that can be downloaded by your colleagues or by anyone else that's
collaborating on your project let's start with a fresh project we're going
to do file new project and we're going to do a new directory new project and
we're going to put that into a first notebook project so as that creates the
project we're gonna see on the right hand side we have a project file that's
our our project we have our console but we do not have the notebook file yet to
do that let's go up to file new file and head over to our notebook now our
notebook is going to look very familiar like an RMD file but there's so much

00:01
more capability to in our notebook and over the period of these tutorials
you'll learn a lot of those features as you can see we have the metadata at the
top one through four we have a title and an output again and it looks very
similar to an our markdown file and then we have the brackets remember the
brackets will create a link if you put the brackets that's the same as putting
it in a href if you know HTML at all and
then here's the site at a link to scroll down to lines 10 through 12 we have
those back ticks we have the programming language called R inside of the curly
braces our studio can run Python code as well when you enable those features and
I think a few other languages so that's why you hit the designate R inside of
the curly braces other parameters can go in there as well and I'll show you some
of those in a minute ok so we're not going to do anything
with code this time but what I'm going to do is I'm going to save this file I'm
gonna do controller I'm going to do command S and we're gonna save it as
first notebook and hit enter and what you're going to see on the right hand

00:02
side as soon as I saved it there's a first notebook dot n B notebook dot HTML
file let's click on that and do open view and web browser so as you see here
we have and our markdown it's an actual HTML
file but what you see that's different about the yard markdown file is on the
very top right-hand side you have this code drop down menu code show all code
code hide all code and you can actually dynamically do this but at the very
bottom of that you see download RMD file so you can send these RMD files with
documentation the code the output everything to a colleague or a co-worker
and you can hide individual code blocks as well by doing this okay let's go back
to the RMD file we should have a plot here it didn't run now it didn't run
because we never ran it we saved it without running it so let's click that
little play button right here and we see
the plot now now let's save it command s

00:03
and go back to our notebook view and web browser we have the plot there see how
that works you have to run the chunks and those are called coab chunks with
those back ticks so if I hide all code it hides that the plot is an output it's
not actual code and I'll show you how you can actually hide that if you choose
to what you can do is in this code chunk from 10 to 12 as a code chunk its
unnamed let's give it a name let's go over here to the settings right here and
the name of that chunk is going to be plot cars and see where it says output
and it says use document default because it's global options and then there's
local options so alko to only show code and I'll put show nothing run code show
nothing don't run code those can all come in handy when you're trying to
demonstrate things that don't need to be wrong but you want to show the code and
have the code highlighting and syntax so right now we'll do every show you show
output only I'm gonna hit apply and you'll see that in the curly braces

00:04
I have more parameters in there echo equals false that means we're not gonna
echo the output to the HTML file and the first part of this verse says plot cars
is the name of my chunk it's helpful to name your chunks for later on so let's
run that again just in case let's hit the command S button and we'll go back
to the notebook view in browser and it does show the
plot and if I do hide all code well it doesn't kill the code I'm sorry let me
let me back up just a tad so the output did show but the the actual code did not
let's see if we can fix that so oh it says show output only let's do show
nothing run code apply that's where I got confused anyways we're gonna run it
again it's gonna show it in it doesn't show it at all okay so it runs the code
so maybe you don't want to show the output maybe there's a bunch of warnings

00:05
or things that are just not part of a documentation that you want now the code
will not be there all I'm trying to show
you is that there's many different chunk options so here we go we have no code
shown and obviously in this demonstration we want to show all code
we're going to use the default hit apply and that's in our notebook for you
what's awesome about it though like I said is you can download these from the
web send this to your friend now they do need the datasets so you
have to send them the data set in this case our data set is called cars but
cars come standard with the art studio in our language itself so they will have
cars but if you had like a CSV file full of business documents or business data
you'll have to send that document as well and if it's all within a project it
should all link up just fine so anyways we can click on code and we can go to
download RMD file and as you can see on the bottom left of my screen it

00:06
downloaded it lets do show in finder and there it is I've got a lot of things in
there I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna close my our studio completely as you
can see I'm recording with OBS by the way and now I'm just gonna double click
on first notebook Rd this is the one I downloaded from we'll call it the
Internet but it was actually locally and
it looks exactly like I had it I can run all chunks click on run up here and I
can run all because you might have multiple chunks in a row or you might
have 25 chunks in this document and instead of clicking each one
individually with this little play button the scroll
play scroll down hit play you could run the entire thing and it should run so it
runs all the chunks if you save it it will allow you to view it in HTML but
this is since it's not a project file it's not gonna show up on my right-hand
side I have to go search for it but that's the idea with chunks I hope that
from this point on we are mainly going to be working in notebooks so hope you

00:07
enjoyed that and I will see you in the next lesson I hope this video was useful
and if it was leave a comment below let me know how and also subscribe that'll
help me grow my channel and continue creating videos like thisEnd of file

welcome back everybody I promised that I
would show you in our notebook which is an awesome awesome thing it's better
than an RMD file it's an actual notebook file which will actually carry over the
code that can be downloaded by your colleagues or by anyone else that's
collaborating on your project let's start with a fresh project we're going
to do file new project and we're going to do a new directory new project and
we're going to put that into a first notebook project so as that creates the
project we're gonna see on the right hand side we have a project file that's
our our project we have our console but we do not have the notebook file yet to
do that let's go up to file new file and head over to our notebook now our
notebook is going to look very familiar like an RMD file but there's so much

00:01
more capability to in our notebook and over the period of these tutorials
you'll learn a lot of those features as you can see we have the metadata at the
top one through four we have a title and an output again and it looks very
similar to an our markdown file and then we have the brackets remember the
brackets will create a link if you put the brackets that's the same as putting
it in a href if you know HTML at all and
then here's the site at a link to scroll down to lines 10 through 12 we have
those back ticks we have the programming language called R inside of the curly
braces our studio can run Python code as well when you enable those features and
I think a few other languages so that's why you hit the designate R inside of
the curly braces other parameters can go in there as well and I'll show you some
of those in a minute ok so we're not going to do anything
with code this time but what I'm going to do is I'm going to save this file I'm
gonna do controller I'm going to do command S and we're gonna save it as
first notebook and hit enter and what you're going to see on the right hand

00:02
side as soon as I saved it there's a first notebook dot n B notebook dot HTML
file let's click on that and do open view and web browser so as you see here
we have and our markdown it's an actual HTML
file but what you see that's different about the yard markdown file is on the
very top right-hand side you have this code drop down menu code show all code
code hide all code and you can actually dynamically do this but at the very
bottom of that you see download RMD file so you can send these RMD files with
documentation the code the output everything to a colleague or a co-worker
and you can hide individual code blocks as well by doing this okay let's go back
to the RMD file we should have a plot here it didn't run now it didn't run
because we never ran it we saved it without running it so let's click that
little play button right here and we see
the plot now now let's save it command s

00:03
and go back to our notebook view and web browser we have the plot there see how
that works you have to run the chunks and those are called coab chunks with
those back ticks so if I hide all code it hides that the plot is an output it's
not actual code and I'll show you how you can actually hide that if you choose
to what you can do is in this code chunk from 10 to 12 as a code chunk its
unnamed let's give it a name let's go over here to the settings right here and
the name of that chunk is going to be plot cars and see where it says output
and it says use document default because it's global options and then there's
local options so alko to only show code and I'll put show nothing run code show
nothing don't run code those can all come in handy when you're trying to
demonstrate things that don't need to be wrong but you want to show the code and
have the code highlighting and syntax so right now we'll do every show you show
output only I'm gonna hit apply and you'll see that in the curly braces

00:04
I have more parameters in there echo equals false that means we're not gonna
echo the output to the HTML file and the first part of this verse says plot cars
is the name of my chunk it's helpful to name your chunks for later on so let's
run that again just in case let's hit the command S button and we'll go back
to the notebook view in browser and it does show the
plot and if I do hide all code well it doesn't kill the code I'm sorry let me
let me back up just a tad so the output did show but the the actual code did not
let's see if we can fix that so oh it says show output only let's do show
nothing run code apply that's where I got confused anyways we're gonna run it
again it's gonna show it in it doesn't show it at all okay so it runs the code
so maybe you don't want to show the output maybe there's a bunch of warnings

00:05
or things that are just not part of a documentation that you want now the code
will not be there all I'm trying to show
you is that there's many different chunk options so here we go we have no code
shown and obviously in this demonstration we want to show all code
we're going to use the default hit apply and that's in our notebook for you
what's awesome about it though like I said is you can download these from the
web send this to your friend now they do need the datasets so you
have to send them the data set in this case our data set is called cars but
cars come standard with the art studio in our language itself so they will have
cars but if you had like a CSV file full of business documents or business data
you'll have to send that document as well and if it's all within a project it
should all link up just fine so anyways we can click on code and we can go to
download RMD file and as you can see on the bottom left of my screen it

00:06
downloaded it lets do show in finder and there it is I've got a lot of things in
there I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna close my our studio completely as you
can see I'm recording with OBS by the way and now I'm just gonna double click
on first notebook Rd this is the one I downloaded from we'll call it the
Internet but it was actually locally and
it looks exactly like I had it I can run all chunks click on run up here and I
can run all because you might have multiple chunks in a row or you might
have 25 chunks in this document and instead of clicking each one
individually with this little play button the scroll
play scroll down hit play you could run the entire thing and it should run so it
runs all the chunks if you save it it will allow you to view it in HTML but
this is since it's not a project file it's not gonna show up on my right-hand
side I have to go search for it but that's the idea with chunks I hope that
from this point on we are mainly going to be working in notebooks so hope you

00:07
enjoyed that and I will see you in the next lesson I hope this video was useful

we're going to put that into a first notebook project so as that creates the
project we're gonna see on the right hand side we have a project file that's
our our project we have our console but we do not have the notebook file yet to
do that let's go up to file new file and head over to our notebook now our
notebook is going to look very familiar like an RMD file but there's so much

00:01
more capability to in our notebook and over the period of these tutorials
you'll learn a lot of those features as you can see we have the metadata at the
top one through four we have a title and an output again and it looks very
similar to an our markdown file and then we have the brackets remember the
brackets will create a link if you put the brackets that's the same as putting
it in a href if you know HTML at all and
then here's the site at a link to scroll down to lines 10 through 12 we have
those back ticks we have the programming language called R inside of the curly
braces our studio can run Python code as well when you enable those features and
I think a few other languages so that's why you hit the designate R inside of
the curly braces other parameters can go in there as well and I'll show you some
of those in a minute ok so we're not going to do anything
with code this time but what I'm going to do is I'm going to save this file I'm
gonna do controller I'm going to do command S and we're gonna save it as
first notebook and hit enter and what you're going to see on the right hand

00:02
side as soon as I saved it there's a first notebook dot n B notebook dot HTML
file let's click on that and do open view and web browser so as you see here
we have and our markdown it's an actual HTML
file but what you see that's different about the yard markdown file is on the
very top right-hand side you have this code drop down menu code show all code
code hide all code and you can actually dynamically do this but at the very
bottom of that you see download RMD file so you can send these RMD files with
documentation the code the output everything to a colleague or a co-worker
and you can hide individual code blocks as well by doing this okay let's go back
to the RMD file we should have a plot here it didn't run now it didn't run
because we never ran it we saved it without running it so let's click that
little play button right here and we see
the plot now now let's save it command s

00:03
and go back to our notebook view and web browser we have the plot there see how
that works you have to run the chunks and those are called coab chunks with
those back ticks so if I hide all code it hides that the plot is an output it's
not actual code and I'll show you how you can actually hide that if you choose
to what you can do is in this code chunk from 10 to 12 as a code chunk its
unnamed let's give it a name let's go over here to the settings right here and
the name of that chunk is going to be plot cars and see where it says output
and it says use document default because it's global options and then there's
local options so alko to only show code and I'll put show nothing run code show
nothing don't run code those can all come in handy when you're trying to
demonstrate things that don't need to be wrong but you want to show the code and
have the code highlighting and syntax so right now we'll do every show you show
output only I'm gonna hit apply and you'll see that in the curly braces

00:04
I have more parameters in there echo equals false that means we're not gonna
echo the output to the HTML file and the first part of this verse says plot cars
is the name of my chunk it's helpful to name your chunks for later on so let's
run that again just in case let's hit the command S button and we'll go back
to the notebook view in browser and it does show the
plot and if I do hide all code well it doesn't kill the code I'm sorry let me
let me back up just a tad so the output did show but the the actual code did not
let's see if we can fix that so oh it says show output only let's do show
nothing run code apply that's where I got confused anyways we're gonna run it
again it's gonna show it in it doesn't show it at all okay so it runs the code
so maybe you don't want to show the output maybe there's a bunch of warnings

00:05
or things that are just not part of a documentation that you want now the code
will not be there all I'm trying to show
you is that there's many different chunk options so here we go we have no code
shown and obviously in this demonstration we want to show all code
we're going to use the default hit apply and that's in our notebook for you
what's awesome about it though like I said is you can download these from the
web send this to your friend now they do need the datasets so you
have to send them the data set in this case our data set is called cars but
cars come standard with the art studio in our language itself so they will have
cars but if you had like a CSV file full of business documents or business data
you'll have to send that document as well and if it's all within a project it
should all link up just fine so anyways we can click on code and we can go to
download RMD file and as you can see on the bottom left of my screen it

00:06
downloaded it lets do show in finder and there it is I've got a lot of things in
there I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna close my our studio completely as you
can see I'm recording with OBS by the way and now I'm just gonna double click
on first notebook Rd this is the one I downloaded from we'll call it the
Internet but it was actually locally and
it looks exactly like I had it I can run all chunks click on run up here and I
can run all because you might have multiple chunks in a row or you might
have 25 chunks in this document and instead of clicking each one
individually with this little play button the scroll
play scroll down hit play you could run the entire thing and it should run so it
runs all the chunks if you save it it will allow you to view it in HTML but
this is since it's not a project file it's not gonna show up on my right-hand
side I have to go search for it but that's the idea with chunks I hope that
from this point on we are mainly going to be working in notebooks so hope you

welcome back everybody I promised that I
would show you in our notebook which is an awesome awesome thing it's better
than an RMD file it's an actual notebook file which will actually carry over the
code that can be downloaded by your colleagues or by anyone else that's
