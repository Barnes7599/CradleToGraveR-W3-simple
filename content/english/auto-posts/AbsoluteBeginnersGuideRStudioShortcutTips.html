today we’re going to learn how to do some keyboard shortcuts that will help
speed up your process when you’re programming with our and our studio our
studio is the IDE and we’re gonna jump right in with a few examples the editor
up here on the top left is what you normally work in so you might be running
the tidy verse you command enter you’ve loaded it you can see it shows up down
here in our console window so we know that it’s been executed now the next one
is test I’m going to do command enter on that and you’ll see over in my
environments it shows test equals test so I know things are going on but maybe
I was on connections tab over here and I didn’t know that test was actually
properly running correctly now this is a very trivial example but you typically
want to go back and forth between the editor and the console and you’re</p>
<p>00:01
usually when you first start out you’re using the mouse all the time and you
know these hardcore programmers are going to say you don’t use the mouse use
your keyboard shortcuts so we’re gonna learn those shortcuts right now so if I
do control number two it’ll bring me to the console at all times so I could type
in the word test and hit enter and you’ll see the output is test so I know
that’s right now to get back up to the editor control number one and this works
for all of the windows that you can see here so including the tabs you kind of
want to memorize the ones that you’re going to be using often for example I
know that control 8 is my global environment see I just typed it now and
you see that it actually activated that tab now I typically stay on this view in
this tab so I don’t really know control 8 as well as I know control 1 and
control two but you can do control up to I believe number nine and it’ll go
through all these tabs so I I want to you know advise you to test them out
like control 5 you can see that it brought me to the files control 6 plots</p>
<p>00:02
and cetera etc so that’s how you can switch between windows pretty easily now
if you did control shift this is a neat one if I do control shift and then the
number one you can see that it maximizes my view
for that particular editor if I do control shift number two it maximized
maximizes my console so that could be pretty useful I use ctrl shift and then
hit the same number again and it’ll go back to your regular normal view very
handy okay now sometimes you want to run a piece of
code but you don’t want to go to the next line so I’m used to doing command
enter and it goes to the next executable line so as you see if I click on tidy
verse up here and I hit command enter it goes to test well let’s say I didn’t
want to do that because you want to run something over and over again to do some
testing or some troubleshooting you can do the option and then return key so if</p>
<p>00:03
I do option return it runs you can see down here in the console it’s running
but that blinking cursor does not actually go down to the next executable
line so that’s pretty handy okay next tip this next tip is a good way to get
the path of your directories that you’re
looking for so let’s say I want to do my
path equals and you put it in quotes you can do dot dot forward slash and then
hit the tab button see when I hit the tab button it actually gives me wherever
my project is located the paths available so if we wanted to go into
animation examples I can click on it and there it is hit the tab again and you
can continue down that path very useful and handy so you don’t to write this
stuff out and sometimes directory paths are you know a little bit more
complicated and you can’t just memorize what they are so it’s a very very
helpful tip okay one other example that I want to show you real quick is how to</p>
<p>00:04
execute all of the code above or all the code below a certain cursor position so
let’s say I’m at this cursor position here and I want to execute all of the
code above what you have to memorize for
this is ctrl alt or control option B for
beginning or e for end so let’s clear my global environments here just to show
you that it’s got nothing there and I’m right here and at the iris thing and I
want to run all the code above it so ctrl alt which is going
option and then the letter B control option B you see it ran you can see
another test equals 13 testicles test it ran everything above it and so control
option e will run everything below it so that’s usually handy you have a lot of
code you want to rerun everything because you screwed something up but but
not anything below it because everything above it so control option B for</p>
<p>00:05
beginning control option e for ending and if you want to run the entire script
as control option r4 run we run the entire script
so remember control option e for end control option B for beginning control
option R for the entire script finally what I want to show you is how to
navigate through a bunch of tabs ctrl tab will tab through if you keep in
control tab it’ll tab through your tabs control shift tab will go backwards so
control tab will go forward control shift tab will go back very convenient
very easy especially if you’re going back and forth between two tabs all the
time so control tab control shift tab control tab control shift tab run your
code it works pretty well when you’re doing some scripting on one tab and some
our markdown than another and it definitely speeds up your process the
next command I want to show you is down here in the actual console if you want
to clear the console window you can do ctrl + L so that will clear your console</p>
<p>00:06
window sometimes if you have a lot of error flags and warnings and you’ve
cleaned it up and you fixed it you want to rerun your code but you want to clear
slate just do ctrl L on the actual console window and for the last tip I
want to just give you one that you might already know is command shift and the
letter amla it’ll give you the pipe operator that is very handy because
typing all those three characters are pretty slow for me but I can usually do
command shift M the letter M and it’s a lot faster I hope these tips are helpful
for you if they are keep practicing them comment below with any tips you might
have or shortcut keys that you use in our studio and please like this video
share on social media for me that I helped me out quite a bit and I look
forward to seeing you in the next videoEnd of file</p>
