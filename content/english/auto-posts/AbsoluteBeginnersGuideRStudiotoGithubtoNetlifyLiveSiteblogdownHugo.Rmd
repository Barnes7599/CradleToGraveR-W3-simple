welcome back today we're gonna almost finalize our little Hugo block down
project by pulling everything that we had in github to a net low fee
deployable site so basically as you commit messages from our studio to
github and you push that code there Netley fee will automatically monitor
that public folder and as it changes it'll update your website today we're
gonna do that so stay tuned this is my main website
it's where I teach how to create content online make money mostly for teaching
people just like this channel here so if you want to check out how to create
these videos check out that site margin grass comm all right so let's get
started we have a project open and if you follow it along from the previous
tutorials you should be at the same steps I have multiple playlists on this
channel so some of them are merged together like for example the absolute

00:01
beginners guide to learn an R has a mixture of multiple playlists in it if
you want something very specific check out all the different playlists I have
for particular interests that being said this is episode 5 of the blog down Hugo
site I believe and what I want to show you is a couple of things let's start
off with making sure that you did commit the right code to github and again you
need to have a github account and you've had to have done the previous tutorial
to follow along so here we go the first thing I want to show you is
let's look at our files real quick so I'm going to look at files I will jump
out of the way so under files you see that I do have a public folder here
right if you don't that means you didn't build your site correctly I'm not sure
how we built in the last tutorial but what you want to do because the site's
already set up you want to do blog down colon colon build site I don't think you

00:02
need to do the Hugo build I believe it's just plain build site so let's just do
that when you build the site that actually creates two public folders it
gives you a synopsis right here how many pages were built
how many static files how many processed image
etc etc right but you're only concerned about the public folder now remember
when I said to commit we can go to get here Louis let's save it ctrl s let's
see if that does the trick so what little show and get is anything
that's actually had a change to it I literally just built this a few minutes
ago so nothing's really changed on my end and that's the problem that you have
that's why they're not showing up here so if you make a change to something
it'll show up if you make a change it's a something that's in github so to speak
you should have a bunch of public folders there so in order to add those

00:03
to the staging area you can do tools shell and remember we would do git add -
just plain public because we want only the public folder
/and I put star there I'm not sure if that's really necessary or not but get
space add space public forward slash star now of course I don't have anything
here but you should or you've already committed to github so this will catch
you up if you didn't you would click the commit button and give it a name we'll
make more reasonable names so there's no changes I didn't make any changes but
then you'd click on push everything's up to date cool oh one thing to note is
when you first start a project when you first wake up in the morning after
you've done all your commits and pushes the first thing you want to do is has
this little down arrow is pull pull from
your github so if you're on a Macbook or a PC and you switch to one or the other
the next day and you want to resume where you left off you would open this
up your little project and pull from the
github so you do the pull so you get the latest version that's just a little

00:04
extra narrative for you all right so we know that everything is on let's see
github that's easy part right everything is easy so we go to github calm you
could see that we have multiple projects mines on the left-hand side you might
have to fiddle around and find where yours is but we have project one here
and I accidentally added everything to it but you literally only need to do
your paw like so under this public folder is
where we're gonna be focused on and if you scroll down you'll see you have an
index.html that's gonna be key for heaven net laughs II find it okay so
simple as that now let's go to net loafie I if you haven't created a free
account do those proper steps so sign up
use your Google or get github account to
sign up etc etc I'm already signed up so I'll just log in if you haven't signed

00:05
up please do so pause this video and then come right back to it now this is
very simple new site from get click on that continuous deployment that's what
we're gonna be doing continuous deployment I you've heard of maybe the
term continuous integration continuous deployment CI slash CD you'll see that
everywhere so now you can say to your potential employer yes I've done
continuous integration continuous deployment because this is what that is
we're gonna do it from github I'll show you anyways how that how that is true
okay so from github it automatically I'm already connected
to my github it'll probably give you a couple steps to connect to your github
maybe ask you for a permission or something like that select yes then
it'll automatically know all of your github projects so allow net Lafite to
access github now the project that I've created was the project one remember so
I have mine right here let's click on that it's simple so it automatically
pulls in my owner I'm the owner branch to you know keep all these probably the

00:06
same build command this is important I don't know if it knows this or if I put
this in previously somehow it knows it but make sure you have build command is
lowercase Hugo and publish directory is public and it's case sensitive so lower
case H and lower case P because you've created a public folder you could have
called it something else you know through blog down build in with extra
parameters you just said hey I don't want to publish in public but make sure
because we're building this is a command net if he's gonna go to our public site
on github and it's gonna know it's a hugo site because we're giving it a
command it's basically on net leafy side
using the command line saying hey how do i bill
this website we're telling it how to do that now now you might have an advanced
checkbox here click on show advanced okay this is cool to find environment
variables this is exactly what you need you need a new variable here and it says

00:07
variable name and value what are we gonna put there let me tell you we are
gonna put in the word Hugo underscore version ole capital all capital Hugo
underscore version and everything is case-sensitive and what value are we
gonna put there well let's go back to our real quick let's do blog down : :
Hugo underscore version and figure out the exact version that you need which
you need everything here zero point seven two point zero is the version that
I have yours might be slightly different copy all three of those values with the
periods so zero point seven two point zero let's go back to net loafie
somewhere and type in zero point zero weight zero point seven two point zero
and you need that lead in zero because it's got what its gonna do it's gonna
actually go to particular websites using that value as a parameter and it'll be
within the URL as a I forget what you call it but that zero matters so zero

00:08
point seven two point zero now click on deploy site and what you'll see
hopefully it might not show you a whole lot right here but mine says in queued
so give it a few seconds a few minutes you can hit the refresh button here if
you'd like which I usually do and you see it's building you can actually click
on it when you click on it and you scroll down you'll see what it's doing
so if you clicked on it a little bit earlier you would have seen these
populate right here and if you got an error it would show you an error and
that's important to find because a lot of people probably will have an error
the first couple times they might have put it wrong version in there or
something like that but remember that URL I was talking about it actually goes
out somewhere and uses that point seven to I right here Hugo static site
generator version 0.72 it it just it needs to be exact that's all

00:09
there is to it but it looks like everything ran just fine right built
completed finished processing build 32 milliseconds whatever it took
now where is this site at well we can click on preview that's where the site
is this is the site and it works all of this works posts all of my posts work
and it's all under a net low fee site now you can customize your net low fee
URL a little bit I believe we're not gonna get into that yet so that's that
you've got a live site that anybody can go to you can share that URL that's up
there it's not very user friendly yet though so in the next tutorial I want to
show you how to customize that that URL just a little bit for free and how to
add posts if you guys liked this tutorial please share it save it show me
your website's post your links inside of
the comments whatever you want to do I'd like to see what you've come up with
what themes you chose we're getting close we're getting close so a few more

00:10
steps and we'll be we'll be on our way you [Music]End of file

off with making sure that you did commit the right code to github and again you
need to have a github account and you've had to have done the previous tutorial
to follow along so here we go the first thing I want to show you is
let's look at our files real quick so I'm going to look at files I will jump
out of the way so under files you see that I do have a public folder here
right if you don't that means you didn't build your site correctly I'm not sure
how we built in the last tutorial but what you want to do because the site's
already set up you want to do blog down colon colon build site I don't think you

00:02
need to do the Hugo build I believe it's just plain build site so let's just do
that when you build the site that actually creates two public folders it
gives you a synopsis right here how many pages were built
how many static files how many processed image
etc etc right but you're only concerned about the public folder now remember
when I said to commit we can go to get here Louis let's save it ctrl s let's
see if that does the trick so what little show and get is anything
that's actually had a change to it I literally just built this a few minutes
ago so nothing's really changed on my end and that's the problem that you have
that's why they're not showing up here so if you make a change to something
it'll show up if you make a change it's a something that's in github so to speak
you should have a bunch of public folders there so in order to add those

00:03
to the staging area you can do tools shell and remember we would do git add -
just plain public because we want only the public folder
/and I put star there I'm not sure if that's really necessary or not but get
space add space public forward slash star now of course I don't have anything
here but you should or you've already committed to github so this will catch
you up if you didn't you would click the commit button and give it a name we'll
make more reasonable names so there's no changes I didn't make any changes but
then you'd click on push everything's up to date cool oh one thing to note is
when you first start a project when you first wake up in the morning after
you've done all your commits and pushes the first thing you want to do is has
this little down arrow is pull pull from
your github so if you're on a Macbook or a PC and you switch to one or the other
the next day and you want to resume where you left off you would open this
up your little project and pull from the
github so you do the pull so you get the latest version that's just a little

00:04
extra narrative for you all right so we know that everything is on let's see
github that's easy part right everything is easy so we go to github calm you
could see that we have multiple projects mines on the left-hand side you might
have to fiddle around and find where yours is but we have project one here
and I accidentally added everything to it but you literally only need to do
your paw like so under this public folder is
where we're gonna be focused on and if you scroll down you'll see you have an
index.html that's gonna be key for heaven net laughs II find it okay so
simple as that now let's go to net loafie I if you haven't created a free
account do those proper steps so sign up
use your Google or get github account to
sign up etc etc I'm already signed up so I'll just log in if you haven't signed

00:05
up please do so pause this video and then come right back to it now this is
very simple new site from get click on that continuous deployment that's what
we're gonna be doing continuous deployment I you've heard of maybe the
term continuous integration continuous deployment CI slash CD you'll see that
everywhere so now you can say to your potential employer yes I've done
continuous integration continuous deployment because this is what that is
we're gonna do it from github I'll show you anyways how that how that is true
okay so from github it automatically I'm already connected
to my github it'll probably give you a couple steps to connect to your github
maybe ask you for a permission or something like that select yes then
it'll automatically know all of your github projects so allow net Lafite to
access github now the project that I've created was the project one remember so
I have mine right here let's click on that it's simple so it automatically
pulls in my owner I'm the owner branch to you know keep all these probably the

00:06
same build command this is important I don't know if it knows this or if I put
this in previously somehow it knows it but make sure you have build command is
lowercase Hugo and publish directory is public and it's case sensitive so lower
case H and lower case P because you've created a public folder you could have
called it something else you know through blog down build in with extra
parameters you just said hey I don't want to publish in public but make sure
because we're building this is a command net if he's gonna go to our public site
on github and it's gonna know it's a hugo site because we're giving it a
command it's basically on net leafy side
using the command line saying hey how do i bill
this website we're telling it how to do that now now you might have an advanced
checkbox here click on show advanced okay this is cool to find environment
variables this is exactly what you need you need a new variable here and it says

00:07
variable name and value what are we gonna put there let me tell you we are
gonna put in the word Hugo underscore version ole capital all capital Hugo
underscore version and everything is case-sensitive and what value are we
gonna put there well let's go back to our real quick let's do blog down : :
Hugo underscore version and figure out the exact version that you need which
you need everything here zero point seven two point zero is the version that
I have yours might be slightly different copy all three of those values with the
periods so zero point seven two point zero let's go back to net loafie
somewhere and type in zero point zero weight zero point seven two point zero
and you need that lead in zero because it's got what its gonna do it's gonna
actually go to particular websites using that value as a parameter and it'll be
within the URL as a I forget what you call it but that zero matters so zero

00:08
point seven two point zero now click on deploy site and what you'll see
hopefully it might not show you a whole lot right here but mine says in queued
so give it a few seconds a few minutes you can hit the refresh button here if
you'd like which I usually do and you see it's building you can actually click
on it when you click on it and you scroll down you'll see what it's doing
so if you clicked on it a little bit earlier you would have seen these
populate right here and if you got an error it would show you an error and
that's important to find because a lot of people probably will have an error
the first couple times they might have put it wrong version in there or
something like that but remember that URL I was talking about it actually goes
out somewhere and uses that point seven to I right here Hugo static site
generator version 0.72 it it just it needs to be exact that's all

00:09
there is to it but it looks like everything ran just fine right built
completed finished processing build 32 milliseconds whatever it took
now where is this site at well we can click on preview that's where the site
is this is the site and it works all of this works posts all of my posts work
and it's all under a net low fee site now you can customize your net low fee
URL a little bit I believe we're not gonna get into that yet so that's that
you've got a live site that anybody can go to you can share that URL that's up
there it's not very user friendly yet though so in the next tutorial I want to
show you how to customize that that URL just a little bit for free and how to
add posts if you guys liked this tutorial please share it save it show me
your website's post your links inside of
the comments whatever you want to do I'd like to see what you've come up with
what themes you chose we're getting close we're getting close so a few more

00:10
steps and we'll be we'll be on our way you [Music]End of file

welcome back today we're gonna almost finalize our little Hugo block down
project by pulling everything that we had in github to a net low fee
deployable site so basically as you commit messages from our studio to
github and you push that code there Netley fee will automatically monitor
that public folder and as it changes it'll update your website today we're
gonna do that so stay tuned this is my main website
it's where I teach how to create content online make money mostly for teaching
people just like this channel here so if you want to check out how to create
these videos check out that site margin grass comm all right so let's get
started we have a project open and if you follow it along from the previous
tutorials you should be at the same steps I have multiple playlists on this
channel so some of them are merged together like for example the absolute

/and I put star there I'm not sure if that's really necessary or not but get
space add space public forward slash star now of course I don't have anything
here but you should or you've already committed to github so this will catch
you up if you didn't you would click the commit button and give it a name we'll
make more reasonable names so there's no changes I didn't make any changes but
then you'd click on push everything's up to date cool oh one thing to note is
when you first start a project when you first wake up in the morning after
you've done all your commits and pushes the first thing you want to do is has
this little down arrow is pull pull from
your github so if you're on a Macbook or a PC and you switch to one or the other
the next day and you want to resume where you left off you would open this
up your little project and pull from the
github so you do the pull so you get the latest version that's just a little

00:04
extra narrative for you all right so we know that everything is on let's see
github that's easy part right everything is easy so we go to github calm you
could see that we have multiple projects mines on the left-hand side you might
have to fiddle around and find where yours is but we have project one here
and I accidentally added everything to it but you literally only need to do
your paw like so under this public folder is
where we're gonna be focused on and if you scroll down you'll see you have an
index.html that's gonna be key for heaven net laughs II find it okay so
simple as that now let's go to net loafie I if you haven't created a free
account do those proper steps so sign up
use your Google or get github account to
sign up etc etc I'm already signed up so I'll just log in if you haven't signed

00:05
up please do so pause this video and then come right back to it now this is
very simple new site from get click on that continuous deployment that's what
we're gonna be doing continuous deployment I you've heard of maybe the
term continuous integration continuous deployment CI slash CD you'll see that
everywhere so now you can say to your potential employer yes I've done
continuous integration continuous deployment because this is what that is
we're gonna do it from github I'll show you anyways how that how that is true
okay so from github it automatically I'm already connected
to my github it'll probably give you a couple steps to connect to your github
maybe ask you for a permission or something like that select yes then
it'll automatically know all of your github projects so allow net Lafite to
access github now the project that I've created was the project one remember so
I have mine right here let's click on that it's simple so it automatically
pulls in my owner I'm the owner branch to you know keep all these probably the

00:06
same build command this is important I don't know if it knows this or if I put
this in previously somehow it knows it but make sure you have build command is
lowercase Hugo and publish directory is public and it's case sensitive so lower
case H and lower case P because you've created a public folder you could have
called it something else you know through blog down build in with extra
parameters you just said hey I don't want to publish in public but make sure
because we're building this is a command net if he's gonna go to our public site
on github and it's gonna know it's a hugo site because we're giving it a
command it's basically on net leafy side
using the command line saying hey how do i bill
this website we're telling it how to do that now now you might have an advanced
checkbox here click on show advanced okay this is cool to find environment
variables this is exactly what you need you need a new variable here and it says

00:07
variable name and value what are we gonna put there let me tell you we are
gonna put in the word Hugo underscore version ole capital all capital Hugo
underscore version and everything is case-sensitive and what value are we
gonna put there well let's go back to our real quick let's do blog down : :
Hugo underscore version and figure out the exact version that you need which
you need everything here zero point seven two point zero is the version that
I have yours might be slightly different copy all three of those values with the
periods so zero point seven two point zero let's go back to net loafie
somewhere and type in zero point zero weight zero point seven two point zero
and you need that lead in zero because it's got what its gonna do it's gonna
actually go to particular websites using that value as a parameter and it'll be
within the URL as a I forget what you call it but that zero matters so zero

00:08
point seven two point zero now click on deploy site and what you'll see
hopefully it might not show you a whole lot right here but mine says in queued
so give it a few seconds a few minutes you can hit the refresh button here if
you'd like which I usually do and you see it's building you can actually click
on it when you click on it and you scroll down you'll see what it's doing
so if you clicked on it a little bit earlier you would have seen these
populate right here and if you got an error it would show you an error and
that's important to find because a lot of people probably will have an error
the first couple times they might have put it wrong version in there or
something like that but remember that URL I was talking about it actually goes
out somewhere and uses that point seven to I right here Hugo static site
generator version 0.72 it it just it needs to be exact that's all

00:09
there is to it but it looks like everything ran just fine right built
completed finished processing build 32 milliseconds whatever it took
now where is this site at well we can click on preview that's where the site
is this is the site and it works all of this works posts all of my posts work
and it's all under a net low fee site now you can customize your net low fee
URL a little bit I believe we're not gonna get into that yet so that's that
you've got a live site that anybody can go to you can share that URL that's up
there it's not very user friendly yet though so in the next tutorial I want to
show you how to customize that that URL just a little bit for free and how to
add posts if you guys liked this tutorial please share it save it show me
your website's post your links inside of
the comments whatever you want to do I'd like to see what you've come up with
what themes you chose we're getting close we're getting close so a few more

00:10
steps and we'll be we'll be on our way you [Music]End of file

00:00
welcome back today we're gonna almost finalize our little Hugo block down
project by pulling everything that we had in github to a net low fee
deployable site so basically as you commit messages from our studio to
github and you push that code there Netley fee will automatically monitor
that public folder and as it changes it'll update your website today we're
gonna do that so stay tuned this is my main website
it's where I teach how to create content online make money mostly for teaching
people just like this channel here so if you want to check out how to create
these videos check out that site margin grass comm all right so let's get
started we have a project open and if you follow it along from the previous
tutorials you should be at the same steps I have multiple playlists on this
channel so some of them are merged together like for example the absolute

00:01
beginners guide to learn an R has a mixture of multiple playlists in it if
you want something very specific check out all the different playlists I have
for particular interests that being said this is episode 5 of the blog down Hugo
site I believe and what I want to show you is a couple of things let's start
off with making sure that you did commit the right code to github and again you
need to have a github account and you've had to have done the previous tutorial
to follow along so here we go the first thing I want to show you is
let's look at our files real quick so I'm going to look at files I will jump
out of the way so under files you see that I do have a public folder here
right if you don't that means you didn't build your site correctly I'm not sure
how we built in the last tutorial but what you want to do because the site's
already set up you want to do blog down colon colon build site I don't think you

00:02
need to do the Hugo build I believe it's just plain build site so let's just do
that when you build the site that actually creates two public folders it
gives you a synopsis right here how many pages were built
how many static files how many processed image
etc etc right but you're only concerned about the public folder now remember
when I said to commit we can go to get here Louis let's save it ctrl s let's
see if that does the trick so what little show and get is anything
that's actually had a change to it I literally just built this a few minutes
ago so nothing's really changed on my end and that's the problem that you have
that's why they're not showing up here so if you make a change to something
it'll show up if you make a change it's a something that's in github so to speak
you should have a bunch of public folders there so in order to add those

00:03
to the staging area you can do tools shell and remember we would do git add -
just plain public because we want only the public folder
/and I put star there I'm not sure if that's really necessary or not but get
space add space public forward slash star now of course I don't have anything

sign up etc etc I'm already signed up so I'll just log in if you haven't signed

00:05
up please do so pause this video and then come right back to it now this is
very simple new site from get click on that continuous deployment that's what
we're gonna be doing continuous deployment I you've heard of maybe the
term continuous integration continuous deployment CI slash CD you'll see that
everywhere so now you can say to your potential employer yes I've done
continuous integration continuous deployment because this is what that is
we're gonna do it from github I'll show you anyways how that how that is true
okay so from github it automatically I'm already connected
to my github it'll probably give you a couple steps to connect to your github
maybe ask you for a permission or something like that select yes then
it'll automatically know all of your github projects so allow net Lafite to
access github now the project that I've created was the project one remember so
I have mine right here let's click on that it's simple so it automatically
pulls in my owner I'm the owner branch to you know keep all these probably the

00:06
same build command this is important I don't know if it knows this or if I put
this in previously somehow it knows it but make sure you have build command is
lowercase Hugo and publish directory is public and it's case sensitive so lower
case H and lower case P because you've created a public folder you could have
called it something else you know through blog down build in with extra
parameters you just said hey I don't want to publish in public but make sure
because we're building this is a command net if he's gonna go to our public site
on github and it's gonna know it's a hugo site because we're giving it a
command it's basically on net leafy side
using the command line saying hey how do i bill
this website we're telling it how to do that now now you might have an advanced
checkbox here click on show advanced okay this is cool to find environment
variables this is exactly what you need you need a new variable here and it says

00:07
variable name and value what are we gonna put there let me tell you we are
gonna put in the word Hugo underscore version ole capital all capital Hugo
underscore version and everything is case-sensitive and what value are we
gonna put there well let's go back to our real quick let's do blog down : :
Hugo underscore version and figure out the exact version that you need which
you need everything here zero point seven two point zero is the version that
I have yours might be slightly different copy all three of those values with the
periods so zero point seven two point zero let's go back to net loafie
somewhere and type in zero point zero weight zero point seven two point zero
and you need that lead in zero because it's got what its gonna do it's gonna
actually go to particular websites using that value as a parameter and it'll be
within the URL as a I forget what you call it but that zero matters so zero

00:08
point seven two point zero now click on deploy site and what you'll see
hopefully it might not show you a whole lot right here but mine says in queued
so give it a few seconds a few minutes you can hit the refresh button here if
you'd like which I usually do and you see it's building you can actually click
on it when you click on it and you scroll down you'll see what it's doing
so if you clicked on it a little bit earlier you would have seen these
populate right here and if you got an error it would show you an error and
that's important to find because a lot of people probably will have an error
the first couple times they might have put it wrong version in there or
something like that but remember that URL I was talking about it actually goes
out somewhere and uses that point seven to I right here Hugo static site
generator version 0.72 it it just it needs to be exact that's all

00:09
there is to it but it looks like everything ran just fine right built
completed finished processing build 32 milliseconds whatever it took
now where is this site at well we can click on preview that's where the site
is this is the site and it works all of this works posts all of my posts work
and it's all under a net low fee site now you can customize your net low fee
URL a little bit I believe we're not gonna get into that yet so that's that
you've got a live site that anybody can go to you can share that URL that's up
there it's not very user friendly yet though so in the next tutorial I want to
show you how to customize that that URL just a little bit for free and how to
add posts if you guys liked this tutorial please share it save it show me
your website's post your links inside of
the comments whatever you want to do I'd like to see what you've come up with
what themes you chose we're getting close we're getting close so a few more

00:10
steps and we'll be we'll be on our way you [Music]End of file

00:00
welcome back today we're gonna almost finalize our little Hugo block down
project by pulling everything that we had in github to a net low fee
deployable site so basically as you commit messages from our studio to
github and you push that code there Netley fee will automatically monitor
that public folder and as it changes it'll update your website today we're
gonna do that so stay tuned this is my main website
it's where I teach how to create content online make money mostly for teaching
people just like this channel here so if you want to check out how to create
these videos check out that site margin grass comm all right so let's get
started we have a project open and if you follow it along from the previous
tutorials you should be at the same steps I have multiple playlists on this
channel so some of them are merged together like for example the absolute

00:01
beginners guide to learn an R has a mixture of multiple playlists in it if
you want something very specific check out all the different playlists I have
for particular interests that being said this is episode 5 of the blog down Hugo
site I believe and what I want to show you is a couple of things let's start
off with making sure that you did commit the right code to github and again you
need to have a github account and you've had to have done the previous tutorial
to follow along so here we go the first thing I want to show you is
let's look at our files real quick so I'm going to look at files I will jump
out of the way so under files you see that I do have a public folder here
right if you don't that means you didn't build your site correctly I'm not sure
how we built in the last tutorial but what you want to do because the site's
already set up you want to do blog down colon colon build site I don't think you

00:02
need to do the Hugo build I believe it's just plain build site so let's just do
that when you build the site that actually creates two public folders it
gives you a synopsis right here how many pages were built
how many static files how many processed image
etc etc right but you're only concerned about the public folder now remember
when I said to commit we can go to get here Louis let's save it ctrl s let's
see if that does the trick so what little show and get is anything
that's actually had a change to it I literally just built this a few minutes
ago so nothing's really changed on my end and that's the problem that you have
that's why they're not showing up here so if you make a change to something
it'll show up if you make a change it's a something that's in github so to speak
you should have a bunch of public folders there so in order to add those

00:03
to the staging area you can do tools shell and remember we would do git add -
just plain public because we want only the public folder
/and I put star there I'm not sure if that's really necessary or not but get
space add space public forward slash star now of course I don't have anything
here but you should or you've already committed to github so this will catch
you up if you didn't you would click the commit button and give it a name we'll
make more reasonable names so there's no changes I didn't make any changes but
then you'd click on push everything's up to date cool oh one thing to note is
when you first start a project when you first wake up in the morning after
you've done all your commits and pushes the first thing you want to do is has
this little down arrow is pull pull from
your github so if you're on a Macbook or a PC and you switch to one or the other
the next day and you want to resume where you left off you would open this
up your little project and pull from the
github so you do the pull so you get the latest version that's just a little

00:04
extra narrative for you all right so we know that everything is on let's see
github that's easy part right everything is easy so we go to github calm you
could see that we have multiple projects mines on the left-hand side you might
have to fiddle around and find where yours is but we have project one here
and I accidentally added everything to it but you literally only need to do
your paw like so under this public folder is
where we're gonna be focused on and if you scroll down you'll see you have an
index.html that's gonna be key for heaven net laughs II find it okay so
simple as that now let's go to net loafie I if you haven't created a free
account do those proper steps so sign up
use your Google or get github account to
sign up etc etc I'm already signed up so I'll just log in if you haven't signed

00:05

using the command line saying hey how do i bill
this website we're telling it how to do that now now you might have an advanced
checkbox here click on show advanced okay this is cool to find environment
variables this is exactly what you need you need a new variable here and it says

00:07
variable name and value what are we gonna put there let me tell you we are
gonna put in the word Hugo underscore version ole capital all capital Hugo
underscore version and everything is case-sensitive and what value are we
gonna put there well let's go back to our real quick let's do blog down : :
Hugo underscore version and figure out the exact version that you need which
you need everything here zero point seven two point zero is the version that
I have yours might be slightly different copy all three of those values with the
periods so zero point seven two point zero let's go back to net loafie
somewhere and type in zero point zero weight zero point seven two point zero
and you need that lead in zero because it's got what its gonna do it's gonna
actually go to particular websites using that value as a parameter and it'll be
within the URL as a I forget what you call it but that zero matters so zero

00:08
point seven two point zero now click on deploy site and what you'll see
hopefully it might not show you a whole lot right here but mine says in queued
so give it a few seconds a few minutes you can hit the refresh button here if
you'd like which I usually do and you see it's building you can actually click
on it when you click on it and you scroll down you'll see what it's doing
so if you clicked on it a little bit earlier you would have seen these
populate right here and if you got an error it would show you an error and
that's important to find because a lot of people probably will have an error
the first couple times they might have put it wrong version in there or
something like that but remember that URL I was talking about it actually goes
out somewhere and uses that point seven to I right here Hugo static site
generator version 0.72 it it just it needs to be exact that's all

00:09
there is to it but it looks like everything ran just fine right built
completed finished processing build 32 milliseconds whatever it took
now where is this site at well we can click on preview that's where the site
is this is the site and it works all of this works posts all of my posts work
and it's all under a net low fee site now you can customize your net low fee
URL a little bit I believe we're not gonna get into that yet so that's that
you've got a live site that anybody can go to you can share that URL that's up
there it's not very user friendly yet though so in the next tutorial I want to
show you how to customize that that URL just a little bit for free and how to
add posts if you guys liked this tutorial please share it save it show me
your website's post your links inside of
the comments whatever you want to do I'd like to see what you've come up with
what themes you chose we're getting close we're getting close so a few more

00:10
steps and we'll be we'll be on our way you [Music]End of file

00:00
welcome back today we're gonna almost finalize our little Hugo block down
project by pulling everything that we had in github to a net low fee
deployable site so basically as you commit messages from our studio to
github and you push that code there Netley fee will automatically monitor
that public folder and as it changes it'll update your website today we're
gonna do that so stay tuned this is my main website
it's where I teach how to create content online make money mostly for teaching
people just like this channel here so if you want to check out how to create
these videos check out that site margin grass comm all right so let's get
started we have a project open and if you follow it along from the previous
tutorials you should be at the same steps I have multiple playlists on this
channel so some of them are merged together like for example the absolute

00:01
beginners guide to learn an R has a mixture of multiple playlists in it if
you want something very specific check out all the different playlists I have
for particular interests that being said this is episode 5 of the blog down Hugo
site I believe and what I want to show you is a couple of things let's start
off with making sure that you did commit the right code to github and again you
need to have a github account and you've had to have done the previous tutorial
to follow along so here we go the first thing I want to show you is
let's look at our files real quick so I'm going to look at files I will jump
out of the way so under files you see that I do have a public folder here
right if you don't that means you didn't build your site correctly I'm not sure
how we built in the last tutorial but what you want to do because the site's
already set up you want to do blog down colon colon build site I don't think you

00:02
need to do the Hugo build I believe it's just plain build site so let's just do
that when you build the site that actually creates two public folders it
gives you a synopsis right here how many pages were built
how many static files how many processed image
etc etc right but you're only concerned about the public folder now remember
when I said to commit we can go to get here Louis let's save it ctrl s let's
see if that does the trick so what little show and get is anything
that's actually had a change to it I literally just built this a few minutes
ago so nothing's really changed on my end and that's the problem that you have
that's why they're not showing up here so if you make a change to something
it'll show up if you make a change it's a something that's in github so to speak
you should have a bunch of public folders there so in order to add those

00:03
to the staging area you can do tools shell and remember we would do git add -
just plain public because we want only the public folder
/and I put star there I'm not sure if that's really necessary or not but get
space add space public forward slash star now of course I don't have anything
here but you should or you've already committed to github so this will catch
you up if you didn't you would click the commit button and give it a name we'll
make more reasonable names so there's no changes I didn't make any changes but
then you'd click on push everything's up to date cool oh one thing to note is
when you first start a project when you first wake up in the morning after
you've done all your commits and pushes the first thing you want to do is has
this little down arrow is pull pull from
your github so if you're on a Macbook or a PC and you switch to one or the other
the next day and you want to resume where you left off you would open this
up your little project and pull from the
github so you do the pull so you get the latest version that's just a little

00:04
extra narrative for you all right so we know that everything is on let's see
github that's easy part right everything is easy so we go to github calm you
could see that we have multiple projects mines on the left-hand side you might
have to fiddle around and find where yours is but we have project one here
and I accidentally added everything to it but you literally only need to do
your paw like so under this public folder is
where we're gonna be focused on and if you scroll down you'll see you have an
index.html that's gonna be key for heaven net laughs II find it okay so
simple as that now let's go to net loafie I if you haven't created a free
account do those proper steps so sign up
use your Google or get github account to
sign up etc etc I'm already signed up so I'll just log in if you haven't signed

00:05
up please do so pause this video and then come right back to it now this is
very simple new site from get click on that continuous deployment that's what
we're gonna be doing continuous deployment I you've heard of maybe the
term continuous integration continuous deployment CI slash CD you'll see that
everywhere so now you can say to your potential employer yes I've done
continuous integration continuous deployment because this is what that is
we're gonna do it from github I'll show you anyways how that how that is true
okay so from github it automatically I'm already connected
to my github it'll probably give you a couple steps to connect to your github
maybe ask you for a permission or something like that select yes then
it'll automatically know all of your github projects so allow net Lafite to
access github now the project that I've created was the project one remember so
I have mine right here let's click on that it's simple so it automatically
pulls in my owner I'm the owner branch to you know keep all these probably the

00:06
same build command this is important I don't know if it knows this or if I put
this in previously somehow it knows it but make sure you have build command is
lowercase Hugo and publish directory is public and it's case sensitive so lower
case H and lower case P because you've created a public folder you could have
called it something else you know through blog down build in with extra
parameters you just said hey I don't want to publish in public but make sure
because we're building this is a command net if he's gonna go to our public site
on github and it's gonna know it's a hugo site because we're giving it a
command it's basically on net leafy side
using the command line saying hey how do i bill
this website we're telling it how to do that now now you might have an advanced
checkbox here click on show advanced okay this is cool to find environment

that's important to find because a lot of people probably will have an error
the first couple times they might have put it wrong version in there or
something like that but remember that URL I was talking about it actually goes
out somewhere and uses that point seven to I right here Hugo static site
generator version 0.72 it it just it needs to be exact that's all

00:09
there is to it but it looks like everything ran just fine right built
completed finished processing build 32 milliseconds whatever it took
now where is this site at well we can click on preview that's where the site
is this is the site and it works all of this works posts all of my posts work
and it's all under a net low fee site now you can customize your net low fee
URL a little bit I believe we're not gonna get into that yet so that's that
you've got a live site that anybody can go to you can share that URL that's up
there it's not very user friendly yet though so in the next tutorial I want to
show you how to customize that that URL just a little bit for free and how to
add posts if you guys liked this tutorial please share it save it show me
your website's post your links inside of
the comments whatever you want to do I'd like to see what you've come up with
what themes you chose we're getting close we're getting close so a few more

00:10
steps and we'll be we'll be on our way you [Music]End of file

welcome back today we're gonna almost finalize our little Hugo block down
project by pulling everything that we had in github to a net low fee
deployable site so basically as you commit messages from our studio to
github and you push that code there Netley fee will automatically monitor
that public folder and as it changes it'll update your website today we're
gonna do that so stay tuned this is my main website
it's where I teach how to create content online make money mostly for teaching
people just like this channel here so if you want to check out how to create
these videos check out that site margin grass comm all right so let's get
started we have a project open and if you follow it along from the previous
tutorials you should be at the same steps I have multiple playlists on this
channel so some of them are merged together like for example the absolute

00:01
beginners guide to learn an R has a mixture of multiple playlists in it if
you want something very specific check out all the different playlists I have
for particular interests that being said this is episode 5 of the blog down Hugo
site I believe and what I want to show you is a couple of things let's start
off with making sure that you did commit the right code to github and again you
need to have a github account and you've had to have done the previous tutorial
to follow along so here we go the first thing I want to show you is
let's look at our files real quick so I'm going to look at files I will jump
out of the way so under files you see that I do have a public folder here
right if you don't that means you didn't build your site correctly I'm not sure
how we built in the last tutorial but what you want to do because the site's
already set up you want to do blog down colon colon build site I don't think you

00:02
need to do the Hugo build I believe it's just plain build site so let's just do
that when you build the site that actually creates two public folders it
gives you a synopsis right here how many pages were built
how many static files how many processed image
etc etc right but you're only concerned about the public folder now remember
when I said to commit we can go to get here Louis let's save it ctrl s let's
see if that does the trick so what little show and get is anything
that's actually had a change to it I literally just built this a few minutes
ago so nothing's really changed on my end and that's the problem that you have
that's why they're not showing up here so if you make a change to something
it'll show up if you make a change it's a something that's in github so to speak
you should have a bunch of public folders there so in order to add those

00:03
to the staging area you can do tools shell and remember we would do git add -
just plain public because we want only the public folder
/and I put star there I'm not sure if that's really necessary or not but get
space add space public forward slash star now of course I don't have anything
here but you should or you've already committed to github so this will catch
you up if you didn't you would click the commit button and give it a name we'll
make more reasonable names so there's no changes I didn't make any changes but
then you'd click on push everything's up to date cool oh one thing to note is
when you first start a project when you first wake up in the morning after
you've done all your commits and pushes the first thing you want to do is has
this little down arrow is pull pull from
your github so if you're on a Macbook or a PC and you switch to one or the other
the next day and you want to resume where you left off you would open this
up your little project and pull from the
github so you do the pull so you get the latest version that's just a little

00:04
extra narrative for you all right so we know that everything is on let's see
github that's easy part right everything is easy so we go to github calm you
could see that we have multiple projects mines on the left-hand side you might
have to fiddle around and find where yours is but we have project one here
and I accidentally added everything to it but you literally only need to do
your paw like so under this public folder is
where we're gonna be focused on and if you scroll down you'll see you have an
index.html that's gonna be key for heaven net laughs II find it okay so
simple as that now let's go to net loafie I if you haven't created a free
account do those proper steps so sign up
use your Google or get github account to
sign up etc etc I'm already signed up so I'll just log in if you haven't signed

00:05
up please do so pause this video and then come right back to it now this is
very simple new site from get click on that continuous deployment that's what
we're gonna be doing continuous deployment I you've heard of maybe the
term continuous integration continuous deployment CI slash CD you'll see that
everywhere so now you can say to your potential employer yes I've done
continuous integration continuous deployment because this is what that is
we're gonna do it from github I'll show you anyways how that how that is true
okay so from github it automatically I'm already connected
to my github it'll probably give you a couple steps to connect to your github
maybe ask you for a permission or something like that select yes then
it'll automatically know all of your github projects so allow net Lafite to
access github now the project that I've created was the project one remember so
I have mine right here let's click on that it's simple so it automatically
pulls in my owner I'm the owner branch to you know keep all these probably the

00:06
same build command this is important I don't know if it knows this or if I put
this in previously somehow it knows it but make sure you have build command is
lowercase Hugo and publish directory is public and it's case sensitive so lower
case H and lower case P because you've created a public folder you could have
called it something else you know through blog down build in with extra
parameters you just said hey I don't want to publish in public but make sure
because we're building this is a command net if he's gonna go to our public site
on github and it's gonna know it's a hugo site because we're giving it a
command it's basically on net leafy side
using the command line saying hey how do i bill
this website we're telling it how to do that now now you might have an advanced
checkbox here click on show advanced okay this is cool to find environment
variables this is exactly what you need you need a new variable here and it says

00:07
variable name and value what are we gonna put there let me tell you we are
gonna put in the word Hugo underscore version ole capital all capital Hugo
underscore version and everything is case-sensitive and what value are we
gonna put there well let's go back to our real quick let's do blog down : :
Hugo underscore version and figure out the exact version that you need which
you need everything here zero point seven two point zero is the version that
I have yours might be slightly different copy all three of those values with the
periods so zero point seven two point zero let's go back to net loafie
somewhere and type in zero point zero weight zero point seven two point zero
and you need that lead in zero because it's got what its gonna do it's gonna
actually go to particular websites using that value as a parameter and it'll be
within the URL as a I forget what you call it but that zero matters so zero

00:08
point seven two point zero now click on deploy site and what you'll see
hopefully it might not show you a whole lot right here but mine says in queued
so give it a few seconds a few minutes you can hit the refresh button here if
you'd like which I usually do and you see it's building you can actually click
on it when you click on it and you scroll down you'll see what it's doing
so if you clicked on it a little bit earlier you would have seen these
populate right here and if you got an error it would show you an error and
that's important to find because a lot of people probably will have an error
the first couple times they might have put it wrong version in there or
something like that but remember that URL I was talking about it actually goes

now where is this site at well we can click on preview that's where the site
