I’m gonna show you a quick tutorial on how to find out if there is a element
inside of a vector so that’s good let’s get started by creating a fake vector
called V that one so that equal to a concatenation or a column of letters so
Z will do a again just show the repeats [Music]
okay so we set our our vector V up command enter on that and then so the
easiest way to check for letters you can say something like basically is the
letter Z and then parentheses in privacy so it’s asking question is Z in the
vector V command engine you get down here at the bottom of truth easy enough</p>
<p>00:01
right let’s try a different letter let’s try R and that should be false and we
get a false because they can’t lead suspect but if we did a will get true
but really no there’s one one in there so let’s let’s try some other methods
here let’s do a any method so we’re going to do is just called any and as a
function and you just put in any a in V well a common we’re gonna see it another
way of doing this we can say any and it’s a function called anything we say
is there any a equal to anything inside of the answer is true</p>
<p>00:02
any are equal to V should be false into this so it’s another method we’re going
to use another one called is dock element is element and it’s simply a
comma so you’re just gonna have to know your functions and which one is going to
give you the best readability it depends on what you’re doing
so there’s an element or instead of using the word in its a combines that
using the Equality operator equals equals it’s a comma C to the various
differences here now let’s do a match and I’m actually slightly different I’m
actually tell you this the correspondent position of the letter so you man
a envy you notice forget the number two out so it’s the second element but it’s
also the fourth element so so be careful with max max won’t give you all of the
results and finally if you want all the results will in tears which which a this</p>
<p>00:03
would be made [Music] see this is what he’s confused which hey
which a is equal to B so two and four which gave me the right example if we do
which and we put our so it’s not in there so be careful on the equal
equality the N and the single return versus the vector of numbers
they’re being returned this could be quite confusing now let’s take this up
one little knot action we’ll use the empty cars as an example let’s do my
data you can set that equal to empty cars that you know show you that my data
we’re going to just pick a random thing here we’re gonna say I would say
horsepower we know those are the 93 is on a horsepower so HP doesn’t hang three</p>
<p>00:04
so let’s play with the fact we’re going to use a vector so the column within at
my data so so let’s do well we’ll start with the first example we’ll say in I
think we should working quote is 93 and now we don’t want to use my data by
itself excuse my 93 in we’re not gonna say in
keep cars cuz what a match to a column so we’ll do empty cars dollar sign and I
said that was the fourth power so it’ll come under the answer is true it is in
there if I did it with that you’re gonna get a false every time because empty
cars is not in itself it’s the in function doesn’t work on the entire data
frame just on vectors within the date range though in horsepower so you think
it’s a true and the same thing would happen if I did other things like I did</p>
<p>00:05
which let’s do which and we’ll say 93 and again now that the which uses the
Equality up here so which 93 is equal to X bars and you
can get a pleasure to speak to get a vector back which turns out to be the
third position so only one I think there was a number in there that was involved
with also my data let’s do one ten says multiple returns on that so let’s just
do 110 we should get one two and four now what
could have been subset so this is just examples what you just matter you swish
so now that we know it’s one two one two
and four we could just say hey return me excuse me um using empty cars about my
data but you know there’s it’s the same thing I’m not making changes damp your
car so it’s not a big deal right now but anyway so we can do my data and we can</p>
<p>00:06
subset literally just those you want just those rows so we can say within the
frame within the data frame we want to do a which statement and we’ll say 110
equals and cheap cars we’re gonna compare it against the horsepower so all
the rows will of course powers equal to 110 and comma I want all the columns so
I’m going to leave the column section blank when it the command enter button
and you’ll see that it returned just those 3 rows that horsepower is equal to
110 you see how that works within the data frame so I just concatenated
basically in this which statement say hey which one of these empty cars
horsepower or equal to 110 returned me a vector and if the vector only has those
positions if I type in those positions basically the return they replace this
entire piece right here with those positions
it’s asking give me those rows with all the columns so it’s pretty simple now
let’s do one more example with just a little bit more so let’s go back to my</p>
<p>00:07
data and we’ll say ok to 75.8 it is displacement so to 75.8 displacement we
can also check the class and displace my
sweet we can check the tight basic class my data displacement and we hit enter a
numeric so since it’s a numeric we don’t have to put the quotes there okay and
that’s just a little little more so my data and I want to subset the ones that
are equal to that so with and I said it was
I forget the numbers already my data one two seventy five point two seventy five
point eight so which 275 two point eight is equal to keep cars and that was the</p>
<p>00:08
dis for displacement right comma I want all the columns man enter and again it
gives me just three results but you see all three results as a two seventy five
point eight displacement now if I didn’t want all the columns I could I could
subset those with numerix as well so maybe I wanna cause one through five and
there you have it simple as that so learn the in the which
the match and how to use it within an actual data frame so you say hey of this
data frame check that particular column and make it happen if you find this up
we’ll go ahead and subscribe and stay tuned for the next oneEnd of file</p>
