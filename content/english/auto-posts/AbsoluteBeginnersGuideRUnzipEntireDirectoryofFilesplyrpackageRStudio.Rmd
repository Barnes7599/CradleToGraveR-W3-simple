okay this is my my live stream for r and i have just set this all up on windows
as some of you know i've been on a macbook and i still am using a macbook
i'm just trying to make a different workflow right now
so my workflow is going to be record and do all of the
programming on a pc with windows and as soon as the record is done it'll
drop it right into my macbook folder and then i can throw it into final cut
pro and edit it but the goal is to be able to do more
not necessarily live edits but the uh minimal amount of editing in general so
i'm trying to streamline that slowly but surely it's getting there i'm just
practicing right now with with my pc setup
all right so that being said let me talk to you about what we're going to talk
about today we are going to be using r and r studio tools to

00:01
unzip a directory full of files automatic automatically
so let me go ahead and show you an example set of files
literally i just put this pc together and i'm using it
and so i'm downloading all these things i need as you can see in my downloads
folder i have a test dot zip and then a few other zip files in there
now i don't really need these anymore this is just an example but imagine you
had 50 or 60 zip files or maybe somebody at your work center is sending you zip
files every day daily and they've accumulated to 30 for the whole month
and you need to unzip each one well instead of going to the right click
extract all clicking all these buttons and waiting you know and then having all
these pop-ups come up for 30 different files we're going to do this
automatically with r so this is a little bit of a deviation from
statistics and machine learning things like that but these tools are
super helpful that i figured i'd throw this in there in the mix

00:02
just to show you how to do it because it's really simple honestly
and with that being said let's do a couple of preliminary things just to get
you started you might need you need the url or the address of these
the location or the path right and in windows you have the path as
just plain download so that's not really going to help you too much
you can right click on the files that are in this location and click on
properties and then we can see down here where it says location you can
usually get an idea of the location that way
we can go ahead and copy this entire location here
highlight it and do control c let's just keep that
so now that we have this let's go back to our rstudio
and what you're going to notice too is that i actually have our
version 4.0 installed if you don't that's fine as long as you have a three
point something version this should work so i'm going to go ahead and go down to
line two here i'll zoom in a little bit for you
so as you can see i'm going to create a uh a directory so we just we just found

00:03
that so we'll call it my directory and we're going to set that equal to our path
but we want to put it in quotes as well so
keep that in quotes and then finally we don't need to see
colon so delete that and remember backslashes like this
are actually escape characters so you can either put a double backslash for
each one or you can convert them all to forward slashes
i'm going to go ahead and convert them all to forward slashes
and you don't need one at the very end here so that's fine so
we've got that that's fine so that's a a placeholder for our directory
now what we want to do is i'm going to show you how to download
a tool that's going to help you called plier so click on
packages down here and then click on install and just type in make sure your
repositories cran type in plyr p-l-y-r and supplier library

00:04
now mine's going to install to the default library which is my 4.0 you
might have a three point something in there that's fine
just click on install it's going to take a few seconds to install
and then you should be good to go make sure install dependencies is also checked
that way if it requires other libraries it'll go ahead and download those as
well all right now that we have that yours should be
loaded by now we're going to add that library so library p-l-y-r
and do control enter on that to load the library control enter on my directory
you can see on the right hand side down here
you have my directory stored my shortcut keys add
a minus and plus and things like that onto the r so don't worry about that
i just delete them okay so let's get going here
we want to get a list of those zip files
right so let's just create a list called zip file

00:05
and this will be the list of files so a convenient thing that r has built in is
list dot files so we're going to use that function and we're going to say
okay what's the path where do we want to look at those files we're going to say
path is equal to and our path is our my directory path so we can make
that into my directory no problem there and we want it to only list files that
are zip files so let's let's add a pattern our pattern is equal to in quotes
star.zip so the star if you don't know stands for basically a wild card but it's
it's as many letters or characters to the left of that star or the left of the
the period actually um it'll grab as long as it has a zip
extension at the end that's all that's saying i'm sure you've seen that before
all right so then we'll do um for we need to put in full names equals true
fold.names that way it gets the entire so because when you're doing this
we can do it'll actually just do users mark g
downloads slash filename1.zip instead of filename1.zip filename2.zip

00:06
filename3.zip we're going to have it have the entire
path so that's why fullnames equals true it's usually a general bet safer to do
because if if if the function doesn't actually know to use a local
directory then it'll take care of it for you because it's going to give you the
entire path and i'll show you that in just a second
so on number six i'll hit command i'll hit ctrl enter
let me zoom back out for you now you can see up here on the right hand side
i have zip file it's got three files in there we can go down to our
command or our console and just type in zip underscore files or file hit enter
and you can see the entire path inside of quotes users mark g downloads
all of them are in there so that's what it did pretty simple straightforward
now that we have that now we're going to use this cool powerful thing called
you know the plier package we're going to use l
d ply which stands for kind of like uh laplay deployer and laplay is hey let's

00:07
apply a function or set of rules to every
single thing in the list and then bring it all back together
so the player function and the player package is really meant for us taking
like a list of objects doing something to each one and then putting them back
together that's all we're doing it's real simple
so we're going to set our data is equal to and our
data is actually equal to our zip files we want to send in our zip files
but now we're going to say what do we want to do with these zip files we're
going to apply a function so the dot fun and then
the function is called unzip and that's just part of the
r base package so you don't have to download anything for this
i don't think it's part of plier but it's it's it could be i'm not 100 sure
on that and then we have to give it a directory
to actually unzip these two so we're just going to do
the same directory so i'm going to call it my directory again
and that should do it so let's go ahead and
control enter on that actually let me show you my downloads again
so you should see my downloads here i'll kind of

00:08
i'll try to bring it up quickly when i run this to see it working so let's go
ahead and do control enter on that and i'll do alt tab
and you can see it was that quick it actually just did that so i have three
new files here that were all unzipped really fast
and all automated that's it that's all there is to it it's
extremely simple to do i hope that you can find
rnr studio to be useful not only for your statistics or any type of program
that you you want to do but use it as a tool in your work area to automate
the boring stuff automate the boring tasks
