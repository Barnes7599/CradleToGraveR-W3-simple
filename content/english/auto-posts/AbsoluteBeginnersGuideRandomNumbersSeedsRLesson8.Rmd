I've got a couple quick tips and tricks for you to get going with a little bit
more are today nothing nothing crazy just quick couple
things that I wanted to mention last time but did not so let's go dive right
into it as always I'm going to try to do a new
file so I'll do an our notebook file and we're going to delete all of that we're
going to give it a heading and say this is a random number generator so generate
random numbers this is our documentation and we might as well put a new title on
there saying random numbers because it's a notebook file remember as soon as I
save it you can use it as an HTML file with code and all that let's insert a
chunk ctrl or command option hi that's our our chunk and in fact we'll name

00:01
that chunk we'll say random number underscore and in the chunk we're going
to reintroduce the sequences remember we
did sequences 1 through 100 and if I hit
command enter you'll see them show up on
the bottom of my screen let's say that I wanted to do another chunk down here I
do well let's do another head and I'll say random number 2 we're gonna do
command option I random chunk or another
chunk we're gonna call this one or we're gonna do 1 through 50 here just for fun
there we go now we have a lot of code and we want to collapse some of this
code we can go up and see what that number 10 is the line 10 that little
down arrow right there click on that and it makes all of the things under that
disappear same thing with all of your your markdown so your heading number 2
anything that's not heading number 2 going down if you click on that 6 it
goes away and then click it again to bring it back so that's how you can

00:02
bring code and chunks and markdown in and out of your actual viewer so that
you can make your workflow process slightly better there's a bird flying
into my window now so I'm a little distracted anyways
we don't really need the second chunk right now let's delete it I just wanted
to show you those little arrows so a random number 1 through 100 that is not
random that is actually a sequence of numbers so we don't want that we want a
random number so in order to do a random
number there's a couple ways there's one called run if and if you do run if
you're gonna put in a a number of random
numbers you want that's the end and then a min in a max or you can just leave
minimax as the default which is 0 and 1 so if I do I want 10 random numbers I
just hit command enter on that and I get
10 random numbers with decimal places if I wanted to make them between 10 and 40
same thing and remember you don't need to explicitly say min and Max as long as

00:03
the parameters are in order I could have
easily said min equals 10 and max equals 40 and run the chunk this way again
doesn't matter and you get the same result so you didn't have to explicitly
say min equals max equals but you should get used to that because a lot of times
the parameter order will matter so that's it gets confusing so if if you're
not worried about order you can skip naming those parameters if the order
matters for sure you have to name them okay so let's run if and we don't really
want to do decimal numbers let's try a different one let's do another chunk
below it and let's do command option I and let's try to get some decimal
numbers so do that we're gonna do a little trick we're gonna use that sample
technique that we used before remember sample is taking a arbitrary
sample or random sample of numbers from a pool of numbers so in order to do that
let's do a sample and our arbitrary set of numbers is going to be we'll do the

00:04
same thing 10 through 40 but remember the sequence 10 : 42 this first
parameter 10 11 12 all the way up for 40 that's my n in this little yellow box
here the or the X and the size we're gonna do the same thing we're gonna do
well actually let's click on size and see what it says and non-negative
integer integer given the number of items to choose so the order of these
parameters are slightly different I want to choose 10 numbers
and it's gonna be from that sample pool so let's command enter that and we have
ten integer numbers pretty cool if I run
it again you run it again and you get we run it using this a set of different
random numbers pretty easy we could set those as variables so let's close one
random two and assign it to a sample of random numbers and let's call this run F
when I hear random 1 and assign that as well and I'll run that so as you can see
in my variables in my environment you see that I have R and 1 and ran too cool

00:05
well let's say we don't want those anymore how do we get rid of those
random variables well I already showed you once that this little brush here
this little broom will erase all of these variables but you might not want
to erase all the variables what if you just wanted to erase the number random
to a random one specifically let me show
you how to do that I will do that in the console so you can run the console at
the same time as running your notebooks or your scripts by going down to the
console here and you literally can just type in well first of all type in the
word LS I don't know what that stands for I forget but it's a linux command
and our command LS will give you the list it'll return the list of the names
of the variables in your environment pretty cool so LS will give you that
list remember that let's say I want to remove a variable we can do RM open
parentheses and just type in let's say we want to remove random variable number
1 if I do that and I run it as you see in the environment it is gone so now if
I try to use Rand one it says object Rand 1 not found but ran to is still

00:06
found you can repeat it all you want it's great or you can remove them all
let's let's let's get Rand one back in gear let's press the play button here
and we have Rand one and two we want to remove them all remember LS open
parentheses close parentheses did a random one a random - it gives you a
list of the names of the variables what I can do is I can do RM so remove and
what do I want to remove I want to remove that list of variables so the
entire thing so I can remove the I'm going to say list equals LS and open
printed closed parentheses because LS will will bring back the list and you
can remove them that way as well so they're all gone as you can see that
being said a couple or things while we're here is something
called a seed I don't really use random numbers without being able to duplicate
this so you have to duplicate what you're doing so in order to do that we
can set a seed and you can say set dot seed and you give it a random number the

00:07
same number though like let's say I want a number at 3:45 if I set that seat I'm
still gonna get random numbers but every time I run this program I'll get the
same set of random numbers it's gonna be
set based on the same algorithm and I'll be able to reproduce this this is very
very important because if you're gonna give this to a colleague or to a friend
or to whoever if you don't set the seat then they truly will get a random number
and they can't duplicate what you've done to try to solve your problem fix
your error or help you along etc etc so with that being said let's run this now
with that seed set as soon as I set that
seed you see my random numbers for R + 1 is 16.5 remember that number I'm gonna
run this again and I'm gonna get the same number every time 16.5 it's the
same same thing with this one now I ran the seed so I'm still living off of that
seed I had this one for R + 2 and I get 18 3800 it's a different chunk so I have

00:08
to set the seed separately so if I go back to this one I should get 16 every
time I didn't set the seed over here so it's truly random but if I set the seed
set the seed and you just give it a number and you just just got to remember
that number and offer it up if you want someone to duplicate it so now we have
16 12 27 and if I click it again same thing same thing same thing you say well
that's not random numbers every time well it is random numbers it's just
random numbers based on that seed so if I chose a different seed let's say the
number 1 those numbers if you look at R and 2 on the in the environments those
numbers change but as I click it again and again the numbers are still that
same random number and if I go back up you still get 16.5 the whole point of
the random seed is so you can duplicate the randomness now you want randomness
because you want to have random outcomes for mostly statistics and for
just anything really that you're programming that you need random numbers

00:09
for so you need those but you also need to duplicate them so that's where the
set seed comes in and you can set the seed multiple times within your actual
chunk so like I can use R and one in chunk number two here so if I do R and
one and I just hit command enter it prints out random one so the variables
its this is called scope the scope of that variable is good for this entire
project so all of these global environment variables are good for the
scope of the project I am I do find it weird that the set seed is not but
that's okay let me show you something else though set so set seed one I want
to delete random one here if I hit the Run button ooh let's see we've got four
random two we have 18 21 18 21 now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set the seed
down here as something different it's number two and then I'm gonna run

00:10
another random sample ten forty ten and I'll run that one and I have a different
set of numbers sixteen fifteen twenty nine so it's different but if I go back
to run this one ah this is where you'll get confused it's going to be a
different set of numbers so random to 402 is eighteen twenty one twenty six
I'm going to run it again and it's going to change because my seed even though
it's not in order this is important too it's not in order but I ran set seed to
sow my seed has changed within this chunk I hit the command enter button and
you'll see that my numbers have in fact changed 38:16 how do I get those numbers
back well have to run set seed one again then run ran two again and I'm back to
eighteen twenty one twenty six so I hope that makes sense is you can run
arbitrary lines of code and because the results and the repercussions will be in
your global environment you could run into a lot of problem and when you
troubleshoot and it's very important to kind of clear everything fresh and start

00:11
all over again especially with those random seeds hope
that made sense I might clear it up a little bit as we
but I wanted to give you something to play with and I'll see you in the next
tutorialEnd of file
