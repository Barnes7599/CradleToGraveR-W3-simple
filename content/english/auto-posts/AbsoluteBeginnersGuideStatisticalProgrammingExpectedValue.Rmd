all right let's go over one more one more thing here we said that the the
true function of Y the true function of y is equal to an actual function of the
observation X plus some epsilon error and the estimated function is y hat is
equal to some function estimate of the actual observation and before I put plus
epsilon but really you don't need to put that because the error is actually even
though it's irreducible we don't need to put that in for it the estimated
function so keep it as that now what happens is the goal is to reduce the
amount of error completely so if I know that this epsilon is part of the error
no matter what so you only have to include a 1 so it doesn't really matter
if I include it here and then when I add

00:01
these together which I'll do in a second you'll have 2 epsilon because e plus e
is 2 e but epsilon is arbitrary so whatever that number is it can factor in
the 2 and it can be just 1/2 so it doesn't matter if you have it twice or
not so let's just cross those out not include it to make things more simple so
what I'm trying to get at is what I want to reduce is the error so I have an
actual true death rate right here then I have an estimated so to minimize the
error if I subtracted the true 1 from the estimate and I square that
difference I want to get that as close to zero as possible right so let's just
subtract the top one from the bottom one so we have Y so the true death rate
minus the estimated death rate right and we want to square it because we want to
make sure that negatives are not involved so we'll just put this in
parentheses and square it and we're going to set that equal to because we're

00:02
just adding two functions we're allowed to do that so we have f of X and F
estimate of X and we have an epsilon so we have and we want to square this two
we want to subtract them I'm subtracting so I'll put in all parentheses
f of X the true function reality that we'll never get to plus some epsilon
plus the F estimate of the X observation and we'll square that as well so the
goal is to make sure whatever this answer is so we have think about it
though this is the number of cases plus some error rate I'm sorry that's a
subtraction sign right here minus this so you want to get this relatively close
to zero and same thing with this we want the death rate to be close to zero so
how do we minimize the death rate so you want to minimize the death rate or

00:03
minimize the error in the y predicted value so how do we do that and that's
what we're going to talk about in the next few lessons but I wanted you to see
this type of formulation so that you can make more sense of it as we go
throughout these lessons so the ultimate goal the ultimate goal is to minimize
this death rate here or minimize the error here we want this to be as close
to zero so minimum is zero so the minimum of the actual rate minus the
estimated rate is what we're going for squared so that's the best we can get
this is point zero zero zero one that's pretty good but point zero zero zero
zero zero one is better so that's the whole goal we'll never probably get to
zero unless it's a fake function or a made-up function now real life you know
it's very difficult to get to zero because they just don't occur in nature
