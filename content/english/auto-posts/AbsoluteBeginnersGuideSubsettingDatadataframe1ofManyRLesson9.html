welcome back to another lesson in our today we’re going to talk about sub
setting data frames I briefly introduced data frames in the previous lessons but
let’s get much deeper into this since this is the heart of our let’s start
another project if you haven’t already done that I’m just in an R script right
now so file a new wire script I’m going to go ahead and use the Emma T cars as
an example for this I really haven’t played with that data set in a while so
let’s take a look at it first by doing a
view and that’s capital V empty cars and
hit command enter on that and it’s going
to open up the empty cars data inside of the viewer okay we have a header file
here with well I’m sorry a header with miles per gallon cylinders displacement
etc etc there’s 11 different features or columns and then there’s a bunch of</p>
<p>00:01
different rows you can see down at the bottom here showing 1 through 18 of 32
entries so there’s 32 rows or observations and 11 total columns and as
you can see there’s nothing in our global environment so let’s make a copy
of this empty cars let’s close that out instead of viewing the cars we’re going
to assign it to a data frame we’ll call it the cars data frame and say equals
basically assign empty cars come and enter you see it comes over here we have
our 33 observations and 11 variables 11 variables features columns whatever you
want to call it they’re all right there okay let’s programmatically do a couple
things to this just to show you a couple functions let’s figure out the names of
the header let’s figure out what the header names are so let’s just do names
empty cars come and enter you see at the bottom it gives me the name
let’s subset only the first three names so let’s do names empty cars but then
we’re going to open up open bracket close bracket and just do 1 colon 3</p>
<p>00:02
that’ll give us the first 3 only so there’s how you do that what if I wanted
the first third and fifth one let’s try that names empty cars and we’re going to
subset now this is something you kind of have to get
to an r1 remember in the previous lesson 1 : 3 is a sequence of numbers it’s
going to return back a list or a vector 1 2 &amp; 3 you can also return back a
vector remember I said to concatenate or
to create a vector of numbers you can do see like column a column of numbers so
see inside of parentheses we want to say 1 3 &amp; 5
let’s do command enter on that and we have M miles-per-gallon displacement and
drat so with the first one miles-per-gallon displacement and drat
you can see that right here so just remember that’s a column or a vector of
numbers a sequence of numbers it’s basically returning a vector 1 2 3 this
is a vector that’s being put inside of
these brackets 1 3 &amp; 5 so that’s how you</p>
<p>00:03
do that now those are the if you were looking at it like this it looks like
it’s going across but picture it as a vector going down like a column it
doesn’t print them print them that way but think of pretty much everything as a
vector going downward so that being said let’s say we wanted to just print off
the entire data frame let’s do empty cars well I’m sorry
let’s do cars cuz that’s what we saved it ask command enter and you can see it
printed the entire thing off well that’s
a little much from my little tiny little console area so let’s fix that let’s
just take say the first 5 rows so let’s do head of cars and we’ll we don’t have
to subset we’re not subset in this one we’re gonna do head cars head is a
function if I hit comma tab you can see my n value and equals a single integer
I’m gonna type in 5 there and I’ll get the first 5 there we go so now you can</p>
<p>00:04
see 1 2 3 4 5 so that’s how you can subset with head and let’s do this a
little bit differently without head let’s do the first 5 rows or
observations by subset and using the bracket notation so cars and we’re going
to open bracket close bracket now since cars is a data frame you see over here
it’s 32 observations of 11 variables you can click on it it’s like a spreadsheet
it’s not like a single vector where we subset it with just one value like
the names up here we don’t need a comma there it’s not like rows and columns
it’s just the columns so let’s do cars and let’s say we one of the first five
rows but we want all the columns well because this is a data frame think of it
think of it as rows comma columns let’s say I want all 11 columns if I want all
11 columns you can do this and hit enter and we get the first you get the same
exact thing as the head cars five so we got the first five rows or observations</p>
<p>00:05
of cars this way we also got it this way now a little shortcut if you want to
also include all of the columns or rows you can do cars and open the subset one
through five comma and if you leave it blank it’ll do the same thing let me
clear this so I can show you a little bit easier leave a blank and you have
the same thing so the blank just means all of them and that same thing goes for
the rows if I hit it again you get all of that data it’s the same as if I
didn’t have anything in there remember okay so those are some cool little tips
on subset and data frames so let’s say we wanted the cars data frame but we
wanted just the first and seventh row so we would do is a concatenation of the
first and the seventh row or the seventh row comma let’s say we only wanted you</p>
<p>00:06
know the fifth and seventh column five and seven so before the first comma we
have the rows that we’re looking for and then we have the columns we’re looking
for this way let’s do community on that and we just have five and seven I was
gonna say that didn’t make any sense okay let’s try this again we have the
two rows rows one and seven and drat and queue sequence so five and seven which
should have correspond with one two three four five which is drat and 7.q
sequence whatever that means I don’t know Oh what does that mean let’s get
out of our console and just type in the question mark
then the empty cars cuz where we’ve got the data from even though we’re using
cars it’s a copy of it and you’ll see it shows up on the right hand side you can
read all about what all that stuff means
so cusack equals quarter-mile time I did not know that and this tells you a
little bit about everything that works with functions data sets cars everything</p>
<p>00:07
a nice little feature to have built in with our studio okay let’s see what else
I can show you let’s say you wanted everything but rows 1 &amp; 7 in that case
let’s do cars and we don’t want let’s do
everything but rows 1 &amp; 7 like I said and we’ll do we only want the columns
there we go , we want all the columns first let me show you one at 7 only
there we go one in seven only there it is the Mazda
rx4 and duster 360 remember those now let’s say we wanted everything but those
we put a little negative sign here and we just hit enter on that and you see
you get a big list but you’re not gonna find the Mazda or the other one so the
Mazda and the Duster will not be in this
list well this is the wag it’s different but I think you guys understand the
point same thing goes with the for the columns if you want every column those
look at these columns real quick we don’t want miles per gallon to say</p>
<p>00:08
right so we’ll just do a minus and we’ll create a vector that just has the first
column in there and remember it’s all on the right-hand side where the columns
are so after the comma we want a vector of numbers that we don’t want because we
have the negative so let’s go ahead and hit enter in that and we should not have
miles per gallon on there it’s gone starts with cylinder learning how to
manipulate subsets or manipulate data frames is going to be crucial for the
rest of our we’re gonna learn though a different way to subset in the next
lesson that’s going to be a little bit more user-friendly and I think that from
this point on you’re going to see them both practice with these though you must
practice subset and data so you have the negative and you have the
include only remember you can have anything inside of these get fancy with</p>
<p>00:09
it do cars open close bracket and let’s not include a sequence of numbers one
through we don’t want the first through fourth row and we don’t want or we want
a column of vectors with just the one five and seven in there
so again just just practice and play around these subsets in and and doing
the negative subset I guess you can call thatEnd of file</p>

the first third and fifth one let’s try that names empty cars and we’re going to
subset now this is something you kind of have to get
to an r1 remember in the previous lesson 1 : 3 is a sequence of numbers it’s
going to return back a list or a vector 1 2 &amp; 3 you can also return back a
vector remember I said to concatenate or
to create a vector of numbers you can do see like column a column of numbers so
see inside of parentheses we want to say 1 3 &amp; 5
let’s do command enter on that and we have M miles-per-gallon displacement and
drat so with the first one miles-per-gallon displacement and drat
you can see that right here so just remember that’s a column or a vector of
numbers a sequence of numbers it’s basically returning a vector 1 2 3 this
is a vector that’s being put inside of
these brackets 1 3 &amp; 5 so that’s how you</p>
<p>00:03
do that now those are the if you were looking at it like this it looks like
it’s going across but picture it as a vector going down like a column it
doesn’t print them print them that way but think of pretty much everything as a
vector going downward so that being said let’s say we wanted to just print off
the entire data frame let’s do empty cars well I’m sorry
let’s do cars cuz that’s what we saved it ask command enter and you can see it
printed the entire thing off well that’s
a little much from my little tiny little console area so let’s fix that let’s
just take say the first 5 rows so let’s do head of cars and we’ll we don’t have
to subset we’re not subset in this one we’re gonna do head cars head is a
function if I hit comma tab you can see my n value and equals a single integer
I’m gonna type in 5 there and I’ll get the first 5 there we go so now you can</p>
<p>00:04
see 1 2 3 4 5 so that’s how you can subset with head and let’s do this a
little bit differently without head let’s do the first 5 rows or
observations by subset and using the bracket notation so cars and we’re going
to open bracket close bracket now since cars is a data frame you see over here
it’s 32 observations of 11 variables you can click on it it’s like a spreadsheet
it’s not like a single vector where we subset it with just one value like
the names up here we don’t need a comma there it’s not like rows and columns
it’s just the columns so let’s do cars and let’s say we one of the first five
rows but we want all the columns well because this is a data frame think of it
think of it as rows comma columns let’s say I want all 11 columns if I want all
11 columns you can do this and hit enter and we get the first you get the same
exact thing as the head cars five so we got the first five rows or observations</p>
<p>00:05
of cars this way we also got it this way now a little shortcut if you want to
also include all of the columns or rows you can do cars and open the subset one
through five comma and if you leave it blank it’ll do the same thing let me
clear this so I can show you a little bit easier leave a blank and you have
the same thing so the blank just means all of them and that same thing goes for
the rows if I hit it again you get all of that data it’s the same as if I
didn’t have anything in there remember okay so those are some cool little tips
on subset and data frames so let’s say we wanted the cars data frame but we
wanted just the first and seventh row so we would do is a concatenation of the
first and the seventh row or the seventh row comma let’s say we only wanted you</p>
<p>00:06
know the fifth and seventh column five and seven so before the first comma we
have the rows that we’re looking for and then we have the columns we’re looking
for this way let’s do community on that and we just have five and seven I was
gonna say that didn’t make any sense okay let’s try this again we have the
two rows rows one and seven and drat and queue sequence so five and seven which
should have correspond with one two three four five which is drat and 7.q
sequence whatever that means I don’t know Oh what does that mean let’s get
out of our console and just type in the question mark
then the empty cars cuz where we’ve got the data from even though we’re using
cars it’s a copy of it and you’ll see it shows up on the right hand side you can
read all about what all that stuff means
so cusack equals quarter-mile time I did not know that and this tells you a
little bit about everything that works with functions data sets cars everything</p>
<p>00:07
a nice little feature to have built in with our studio okay let’s see what else
I can show you let’s say you wanted everything but rows 1 &amp; 7 in that case
let’s do cars and we don’t want let’s do
everything but rows 1 &amp; 7 like I said and we’ll do we only want the columns
there we go , we want all the columns first let me show you one at 7 only
there we go one in seven only there it is the Mazda
rx4 and duster 360 remember those now let’s say we wanted everything but those
we put a little negative sign here and we just hit enter on that and you see
you get a big list but you’re not gonna find the Mazda or the other one so the
Mazda and the Duster will not be in this
list well this is the wag it’s different but I think you guys understand the
point same thing goes with the for the columns if you want every column those
look at these columns real quick we don’t want miles per gallon to say</p>
<p>00:08
right so we’ll just do a minus and we’ll create a vector that just has the first
column in there and remember it’s all on the right-hand side where the columns
are so after the comma we want a vector of numbers that we don’t want because we
have the negative so let’s go ahead and hit enter in that and we should not have
miles per gallon on there it’s gone starts with cylinder learning how to
manipulate subsets or manipulate data frames is going to be crucial for the
rest of our we’re gonna learn though a different way to subset in the next
lesson that’s going to be a little bit more user-friendly and I think that from
this point on you’re going to see them both practice with these though you must
practice subset and data so you have the negative and you have the
include only remember you can have anything inside of these get fancy with</p>
<p>00:09
it do cars open close bracket and let’s not include a sequence of numbers one
through we don’t want the first through fourth row and we don’t want or we want
a column of vectors with just the one five and seven in there
so again just just practice and play around these subsets in and and doing
the negative subset I guess you can call thatEnd of file</p>

welcome back to another lesson in our today we’re going to talk about sub
setting data frames I briefly introduced data frames in the previous lessons but
let’s get much deeper into this since this is the heart of our let’s start
another project if you haven’t already done that I’m just in an R script right
now so file a new wire script I’m going to go ahead and use the Emma T cars as
an example for this I really haven’t played with that data set in a while so
let’s take a look at it first by doing a
view and that’s capital V empty cars and
hit command enter on that and it’s going
to open up the empty cars data inside of the viewer okay we have a header file
here with well I’m sorry a header with miles per gallon cylinders displacement
etc etc there’s 11 different features or columns and then there’s a bunch of</p>
<p>00:01
different rows you can see down at the bottom here showing 1 through 18 of 32
entries so there’s 32 rows or observations and 11 total columns and as
you can see there’s nothing in our global environment so let’s make a copy
of this empty cars let’s close that out instead of viewing the cars we’re going
to assign it to a data frame we’ll call it the cars data frame and say equals
basically assign empty cars come and enter you see it comes over here we have
our 33 observations and 11 variables 11 variables features columns whatever you
want to call it they’re all right there okay let’s programmatically do a couple
things to this just to show you a couple functions let’s figure out the names of
the header let’s figure out what the header names are so let’s just do names
empty cars come and enter you see at the bottom it gives me the name
let’s subset only the first three names so let’s do names empty cars but then
we’re going to open up open bracket close bracket and just do 1 colon 3</p>
<p>00:02
that’ll give us the first 3 only so there’s how you do that what if I wanted
the first third and fifth one let’s try that names empty cars and we’re going to

let’s subset only the first three names so let’s do names empty cars but then
we’re going to open up open bracket close bracket and just do 1 colon 3</p>
<p>00:02
that’ll give us the first 3 only so there’s how you do that what if I wanted
the first third and fifth one let’s try that names empty cars and we’re going to
subset now this is something you kind of have to get
to an r1 remember in the previous lesson 1 : 3 is a sequence of numbers it’s
going to return back a list or a vector 1 2 &amp; 3 you can also return back a
vector remember I said to concatenate or
to create a vector of numbers you can do see like column a column of numbers so
see inside of parentheses we want to say 1 3 &amp; 5
let’s do command enter on that and we have M miles-per-gallon displacement and
drat so with the first one miles-per-gallon displacement and drat
you can see that right here so just remember that’s a column or a vector of
numbers a sequence of numbers it’s basically returning a vector 1 2 3 this
is a vector that’s being put inside of
these brackets 1 3 &amp; 5 so that’s how you</p>
<p>00:03
do that now those are the if you were looking at it like this it looks like
it’s going across but picture it as a vector going down like a column it
doesn’t print them print them that way but think of pretty much everything as a
vector going downward so that being said let’s say we wanted to just print off
the entire data frame let’s do empty cars well I’m sorry
let’s do cars cuz that’s what we saved it ask command enter and you can see it
printed the entire thing off well that’s
a little much from my little tiny little console area so let’s fix that let’s
just take say the first 5 rows so let’s do head of cars and we’ll we don’t have
to subset we’re not subset in this one we’re gonna do head cars head is a
function if I hit comma tab you can see my n value and equals a single integer
I’m gonna type in 5 there and I’ll get the first 5 there we go so now you can</p>
<p>00:04
see 1 2 3 4 5 so that’s how you can subset with head and let’s do this a
little bit differently without head let’s do the first 5 rows or
observations by subset and using the bracket notation so cars and we’re going
to open bracket close bracket now since cars is a data frame you see over here
it’s 32 observations of 11 variables you can click on it it’s like a spreadsheet
it’s not like a single vector where we subset it with just one value like
the names up here we don’t need a comma there it’s not like rows and columns
it’s just the columns so let’s do cars and let’s say we one of the first five
rows but we want all the columns well because this is a data frame think of it
think of it as rows comma columns let’s say I want all 11 columns if I want all
11 columns you can do this and hit enter and we get the first you get the same
exact thing as the head cars five so we got the first five rows or observations</p>
<p>00:05
of cars this way we also got it this way now a little shortcut if you want to
also include all of the columns or rows you can do cars and open the subset one
through five comma and if you leave it blank it’ll do the same thing let me
clear this so I can show you a little bit easier leave a blank and you have
the same thing so the blank just means all of them and that same thing goes for
the rows if I hit it again you get all of that data it’s the same as if I
didn’t have anything in there remember okay so those are some cool little tips
on subset and data frames so let’s say we wanted the cars data frame but we
wanted just the first and seventh row so we would do is a concatenation of the
first and the seventh row or the seventh row comma let’s say we only wanted you</p>
<p>00:06
know the fifth and seventh column five and seven so before the first comma we
have the rows that we’re looking for and then we have the columns we’re looking
for this way let’s do community on that and we just have five and seven I was
gonna say that didn’t make any sense okay let’s try this again we have the
two rows rows one and seven and drat and queue sequence so five and seven which
should have correspond with one two three four five which is drat and 7.q
sequence whatever that means I don’t know Oh what does that mean let’s get
out of our console and just type in the question mark
then the empty cars cuz where we’ve got the data from even though we’re using
cars it’s a copy of it and you’ll see it shows up on the right hand side you can
read all about what all that stuff means
so cusack equals quarter-mile time I did not know that and this tells you a
little bit about everything that works with functions data sets cars everything</p>
<p>00:07
a nice little feature to have built in with our studio okay let’s see what else
I can show you let’s say you wanted everything but rows 1 &amp; 7 in that case
let’s do cars and we don’t want let’s do
everything but rows 1 &amp; 7 like I said and we’ll do we only want the columns
there we go , we want all the columns first let me show you one at 7 only
there we go one in seven only there it is the Mazda
rx4 and duster 360 remember those now let’s say we wanted everything but those
we put a little negative sign here and we just hit enter on that and you see
you get a big list but you’re not gonna find the Mazda or the other one so the
Mazda and the Duster will not be in this
list well this is the wag it’s different but I think you guys understand the
point same thing goes with the for the columns if you want every column those
look at these columns real quick we don’t want miles per gallon to say</p>
<p>00:08
right so we’ll just do a minus and we’ll create a vector that just has the first
column in there and remember it’s all on the right-hand side where the columns
are so after the comma we want a vector of numbers that we don’t want because we
have the negative so let’s go ahead and hit enter in that and we should not have
miles per gallon on there it’s gone starts with cylinder learning how to
manipulate subsets or manipulate data frames is going to be crucial for the
rest of our we’re gonna learn though a different way to subset in the next
lesson that’s going to be a little bit more user-friendly and I think that from
this point on you’re going to see them both practice with these though you must
practice subset and data so you have the negative and you have the
include only remember you can have anything inside of these get fancy with</p>
<p>00:09
it do cars open close bracket and let’s not include a sequence of numbers one
through we don’t want the first through fourth row and we don’t want or we want
a column of vectors with just the one five and seven in there
so again just just practice and play around these subsets in and and doing
the negative subset I guess you can call thatEnd of file</p>

welcome back to another lesson in our today we’re going to talk about sub
setting data frames I briefly introduced data frames in the previous lessons but
let’s get much deeper into this since this is the heart of our let’s start
another project if you haven’t already done that I’m just in an R script right
now so file a new wire script I’m going to go ahead and use the Emma T cars as
an example for this I really haven’t played with that data set in a while so
let’s take a look at it first by doing a
view and that’s capital V empty cars and
hit command enter on that and it’s going
to open up the empty cars data inside of the viewer okay we have a header file
here with well I’m sorry a header with miles per gallon cylinders displacement
etc etc there’s 11 different features or columns and then there’s a bunch of</p>
<p>00:01
different rows you can see down at the bottom here showing 1 through 18 of 32
entries so there’s 32 rows or observations and 11 total columns and as
you can see there’s nothing in our global environment so let’s make a copy
of this empty cars let’s close that out instead of viewing the cars we’re going
to assign it to a data frame we’ll call it the cars data frame and say equals
basically assign empty cars come and enter you see it comes over here we have
our 33 observations and 11 variables 11 variables features columns whatever you
want to call it they’re all right there okay let’s programmatically do a couple
things to this just to show you a couple functions let’s figure out the names of
the header let’s figure out what the header names are so let’s just do names
empty cars come and enter you see at the bottom it gives me the name
let’s subset only the first three names so let’s do names empty cars but then
we’re going to open up open bracket close bracket and just do 1 colon 3</p>
<p>00:02
that’ll give us the first 3 only so there’s how you do that what if I wanted
the first third and fifth one let’s try that names empty cars and we’re going to
subset now this is something you kind of have to get
to an r1 remember in the previous lesson 1 : 3 is a sequence of numbers it’s
going to return back a list or a vector 1 2 &amp; 3 you can also return back a
vector remember I said to concatenate or
to create a vector of numbers you can do see like column a column of numbers so
see inside of parentheses we want to say 1 3 &amp; 5
let’s do command enter on that and we have M miles-per-gallon displacement and
drat so with the first one miles-per-gallon displacement and drat
you can see that right here so just remember that’s a column or a vector of
numbers a sequence of numbers it’s basically returning a vector 1 2 3 this
is a vector that’s being put inside of
these brackets 1 3 &amp; 5 so that’s how you</p>
<p>00:03
do that now those are the if you were looking at it like this it looks like
it’s going across but picture it as a vector going down like a column it
doesn’t print them print them that way but think of pretty much everything as a
vector going downward so that being said let’s say we wanted to just print off
the entire data frame let’s do empty cars well I’m sorry
let’s do cars cuz that’s what we saved it ask command enter and you can see it
printed the entire thing off well that’s
a little much from my little tiny little console area so let’s fix that let’s
just take say the first 5 rows so let’s do head of cars and we’ll we don’t have
to subset we’re not subset in this one we’re gonna do head cars head is a
function if I hit comma tab you can see my n value and equals a single integer
I’m gonna type in 5 there and I’ll get the first 5 there we go so now you can</p>
<p>00:04
see 1 2 3 4 5 so that’s how you can subset with head and let’s do this a
little bit differently without head let’s do the first 5 rows or
observations by subset and using the bracket notation so cars and we’re going
to open bracket close bracket now since cars is a data frame you see over here
it’s 32 observations of 11 variables you can click on it it’s like a spreadsheet
it’s not like a single vector where we subset it with just one value like
the names up here we don’t need a comma there it’s not like rows and columns
it’s just the columns so let’s do cars and let’s say we one of the first five
rows but we want all the columns well because this is a data frame think of it
think of it as rows comma columns let’s say I want all 11 columns if I want all
11 columns you can do this and hit enter and we get the first you get the same
exact thing as the head cars five so we got the first five rows or observations</p>
<p>00:05

a nice little feature to have built in with our studio okay let’s see what else
I can show you let’s say you wanted everything but rows 1 &amp; 7 in that case
let’s do cars and we don’t want let’s do
everything but rows 1 &amp; 7 like I said and we’ll do we only want the columns
there we go , we want all the columns first let me show you one at 7 only
there we go one in seven only there it is the Mazda
rx4 and duster 360 remember those now let’s say we wanted everything but those
we put a little negative sign here and we just hit enter on that and you see
you get a big list but you’re not gonna find the Mazda or the other one so the

point same thing goes with the for the columns if you want every column those
look at these columns real quick we don’t want miles per gallon to say</p>
<p>00:08
right so we’ll just do a minus and we’ll create a vector that just has the first
column in there and remember it’s all on the right-hand side where the columns
are so after the comma we want a vector of numbers that we don’t want because we
have the negative so let’s go ahead and hit enter in that and we should not have
miles per gallon on there it’s gone starts with cylinder learning how to
manipulate subsets or manipulate data frames is going to be crucial for the
rest of our we’re gonna learn though a different way to subset in the next
lesson that’s going to be a little bit more user-friendly and I think that from
this point on you’re going to see them both practice with these though you must
practice subset and data so you have the negative and you have the
include only remember you can have anything inside of these get fancy with</p>
<p>00:09
it do cars open close bracket and let’s not include a sequence of numbers one
through we don’t want the first through fourth row and we don’t want or we want
a column of vectors with just the one five and seven in there
so again just just practice and play around these subsets in and and doing
the negative subset I guess you can call thatEnd of file</p>
