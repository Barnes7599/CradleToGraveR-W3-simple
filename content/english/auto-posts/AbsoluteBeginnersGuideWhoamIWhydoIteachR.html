looks like we’re live now the first time scheduling a live YouTube stream but I
have I have done live a couple times not
scheduled and I literally just scheduled just like 25 minutes ago so I didn’t
have a chance to set it up perfect I learned to be able to do hotkeys and
show you screens and go back and forth but honestly I’m in the middle of a new
setup I’ve got a PC coming in but I have all kinds of weird wires everywhere all
around me because I’ve been troubleshooting problems too I’ve had
HDMI connection problems I had broken cables I was trying to use these
switchers to switch between three different computers and I can’t switch
everything because I have my work computer that you can’t plug things into</p>
<p>00:01
the USB Drive so I can’t switch hard drives that way anyways it’s been a mess
the last couple days have been a mess I was hoping to get my new PC case and all
that other stuff over the weekend but I will wait till Tuesday and probably
start putting it together then I’ve never built a PC but that’s my plan my
plans were to do that over this weekend but obviously that didn’t happen so here
I am I want to do more are tutorials but
I am in such a mess between like screens and cables and my my DSLR camera wasn’t
like connect and write to all the different computers that I have I have
an old HP from like 2012 it’s not working very well it’s super loud so
I’ve been trying to put off any new recordings because of that mostly and
the fact that I didn’t have a capture card so all of the stuff that you’ve
been seeing from this point on was usually through workarounds band-aids</p>
<p>00:02
so yes it’s through a DSLR which is nice and I have a nice microphone which also
helps but it’s still a band-aid because I had to use all kinds of third-party
software to get my Canon DSLR to output to the MacBook and
and I finally was switching over to a PC
and I’d use like beta software webcam it was just a mess anyways that’s the
struggle and that’s part of the struggle of teaching is is you have to deal with
all of that stuff I like to try to teach are in a manner that will keep the the
person engaged I know that it can be born at times I like to keep my lessons
pretty short to keep your focus as well change views and things like that so
I’ve been messing around with some of the some of the live stream type
software you know like I’m using OBS online broadcast system I think it
stands for but all these shortcut keys to switch angles and switch views and</p>
<p>00:03
zoom in on code zoom back out on code things like that it really helps I think
to keep the user engaged but you know that being said I have nothing for that
today for this live stream so but I just wanted to talk about some of my
background and my credentials to help you understand where I come from and and
and so that I don’t mislead you into thinking that I’m some expert expert at
any of this I’m learning just like you guys are so that being said I did have
quite a few computer science courses through college and when I was in high
school I’ve also taken some computer science courses but my main language was
C++ programming I was I loved it I ate that up I loved object-oriented
programming I I never did it as a career but I did it academically throughout
high school and college quite a bit advanced C++ I was creating like little
Windows GUI interfaces from base C++ you know well the Microsoft foundation</p>
<p>00:04
classes and the win32 API things like that I’ve learned a lot about
programming and it helped me a lot in my career now I I have a unique story I
suppose where you know I never actually did program for a living it’s not my
career but I did I did troubleshoot electronics and I had to troubleshoot
you know all these different circuit boards for the air force things like
that and you have to get into the code and dabble with it a little bit too you
know we you know reset up all these relays and check the voltage here apply
voltages there things like that so I do have some experience in the real world
doing real world work when it comes to electronics engineering sort of I don’t
want to over oversell it because it was just swapped Ronix but I did dabble you
know and I’ve always dabbled in some sort of web programming but never long
enough to really get to be an expert in any of it
I would try it I would learn it I would make it work and then I would stop and</p>
<p>00:05
the reason why is because it’s not my job and it’s really hard to find the
time outside of your you know eight or nine hours a day that you’re at your
work your travel time to come home and learn something that it’s pretty fun I
think I enjoy it but hey how’s it going I see you online it’s good too good to
see somebody on here this is this is new I’ve gone lab like maybe once or twice
but I never actually promoted it beforehand and this time I I did like
literally 20 minutes before oh I got the discord going over here we got people
asking for pizza I like it let’s see let
me see if I can login it’s a discord I’m new to discord as well just so you know
but I’ve been using it for another another server for trying to talk to</p>
<p>00:06
people around the world which is pretty cool so I’ve gained lots of people from
Belgium we’ve got people from Colombia Serbia obviously the United States quite
a bit it’s pretty fun so I learned that discord was a really good place for a
community now I don’t really game which I might change that because I’m building
this really badass PC so I might get into gaming I’ve never done it before
I’ll probably be pretty bad at it but I might give it a shot you know and that
all that spare time that I have but yeah back to uh you know teaching teach and
are is fun I enjoy teaching when you know the subject it’s so easy to do when
you don’t know it does take some time and and it’s a little bit of a hassle like
I’ve taught my first course that I actually taught like pretty legit it was
a C++ program and because that was my academic level I mean I did C++ in high
school and college I did advanced C++ but again I never did it in industry I
never did it in the real world but still learned all the concepts and a lot of</p>
<p>00:07
computer science concepts you know so it really helps so R is unique that it’s
it’s definitely geared towards data scientists and it’s geared towards
statisticians and not as much as programming but all of those things are
mixing together they are overlapping you
you know if you can’t be an engineer now without knowin programming at all you
have to know some sort of programming but R was unique coming from C++ because
just the littlest things like not using a for loop was difficult to grasp my
grasp you know in are you thinking about everything is like a matrix you know as
a whatever a column of numbers are column of data and you’re gonna apply
functions to each row of that column or to you know something like that anyways
but anyways I learned are mostly through a course I took in college called I</p>
<p>00:08
think it was called machine learning and data mining and it was a advanced
masters level course and it was really fun I learned a lot about all the
different types of classifications like you have linear discriminant analysis
you have your K n K nearest neighbors you might have heard of logistic
regression you have just just all kinds of thing quadratic quadratic analysis
logistic regression different sampling methods how to train your data the
various ways you can train your data to leave one out cross validation let me
think so a lot of it was literally just learn
it do a few problems go on to the next one and learn it and then as you need
them you would use them it’s really interesting though because computers are
so powerful now you can try every combination variables to try to get the best
predicted you know model or best model that can do the predictions so I’m not a</p>
<p>00:09
statistician and I’m not a programmer I am none of those things but I do enjoy
it as a layman I don’t dabble that often so I will read up on some subject and
then try to teach it I have kind of been known to be able to teach complex
subjects to the layman I suppose even at work that is my you know people say
you’re really good at explaining like the big picture or why the reasoning
behind things and so that’s kind of what I wanted to talk about here in this
little platform just to give somebody some perspective and what I do now
mostly I manage and well I’m kind of like a program manager for a lot of IT
related projects so I don’t actually run the day-to-day activities for all of
these projects but some of them I do so there’s about ten projects that I manage
and they’re all IT related or data related so I learned a lot about data</p>
<p>00:10
governance database management all of those things there’s one project that
has to do with ata advanced text analytics and that one’s
pretty fun I allow the smees the subject matter experts to come in and kind of
try to run the show right but I’m the overarching manager of the
entire program so all these ten projects have to come back and basically all of
them have to gear towards the mission of our organization and if it doesn’t then
you know I have to explain why not so that’s what I do I manage a lot of
contractors in all these little various projects now the advanced text analytics
I have to ask them why why are we doing this what’s the purpose right so we take
lots and lots of information and we don’t know what it is it’s not there’s
no metadata there’s no data that tells you what the data is data about data is
metadata right and so what a lot of the subject matter experts will start
talking jargon they’ll start talking some advanced you know vector</p>
<p>00:11
manipulation for trying to get a closer proximity of two words being like the
being associated here you know whatever the heck it is I can’t think of all the
terms now but you know that doesn’t help the cause for the business side so how
do I explain that to the leadership to the decision-makers the people with the
purse right the money strings so I have to always try to translate what’s going
on into in the data science e world in the IT world translate that to a
business outcome and say this is why your reviewers are struggling to find
information so I’m trying to have a information retrieval algorithm that
works better than what’s out there and now am i doing the coding no the
contractors are but I’m managing the overall progress of the projects they’re
using Python by the way for the most part and a lot of Java C sharp they’re I
mean it’s it’s all over the place now R is good for research and quick data but</p>
<p>00:12
it really hasn’t really entered the production realm as far as I know I did
a little bit of our shiny butt and we have some are shiny pilot programs going
on but really nothing the equivalent to something in a production environment we
don’t have that but so that’s that’s basically me is I that are interested in
data science and because they’re interested it’s a very interesting job
so I get to see the results of what a lot of hard workers do and I get to
steer their direction towards the mission objectives and knowing you know
how much something takes to code or knowing that the code is working or not
understanding when somebody tells me you
know the underlying algorithms or what a
neural network is understanding what all that is without actually program in it
or coding it myself is is crucial for my job because I have to hire these people
and I have to keep an eye on them as far</p>
<p>00:13
as are they going in the right direction right so eventually with this channel I
know I’m kind of all over the place but we are going to get into like decision
trees we’re going to get into machine learning we’re gonna do neural networks
we’re gonna do classifications supervised and unsupervised learning
those are all coming up and I hope I hope that
once I get my new PC I hope that I can do it a lot faster than I am
C let me check the audio I wonder if the
audio even works we don’t know yeah so I think we have a few people maybe in his
chat at least one it’s not easy going live unplanned but again I am so I’ve
got everything everywhere all over my desk from troubleshooting that I gave up
on I’m trying to do an hour lesson today
but yeah another thing is support vector machines will do some basic neural</p>
<p>00:14
networks those are really cool one thing to note about neural networks is is a
lot of people say like here’s a misconception they say it’s a black box
and it and it is like it’s a black box because imagine you have something like
you know 500 600 variables going across you know the columns you have 500
features and you’ve got you know a million rows of data and you’re gonna
try to train this data you’re gonna run a model on the data on a part of the
data so when you get into actually training the data you train part of the
data and you save a set aside to test out your model to see if it’s good
because how else would you do that without the future actually coming you
know so if you have data that’s a million rows you would want to maybe
take 700,000 rows run your algorithms your models on those train it and then
once it’s done trained being trained you
would then take the rest of the data the 30 percent or sometimes people will</p>
<p>00:15
split that up into a they call it a training set test set and a validation
set something like that right but you can really just cut it into two for now
training and validation slash test yeah deep learning it’s so fun as soon as we
get into it it’s gonna be a little bit quicker faster faster pace it’ll
definitely be nice to have some of the principles of why they work ahead of
time I hope that I hope that I can portray that pretty quick and then jump
into machine learning because the machine learning is where it’s at that’s
what everybody wants to learn that’s the the fun stuff now with now I
don’t know how to do advanced advanced machine learning I know how to do the
basics you know in our how’d I get them started but you can get some pretty
advanced machine learning going on with like tensorflow or pi torch or just
advanced features that use like the GPU versus the CPU I’m not an expert at any
of it but I will definitely teach the basics of all of them so that you can</p>
<p>00:16
move forward with it and and try to explore your own there was a really good
podcast by Ossie devel in fact I’ll get a link and I’ll throw it in the chat
that I learned a lot like you will learn basically all of the lingo and what’s
going on just by listening to the podcast and it’s and it’s pretty
technical but it’s it’s it’s definitely you don’t need a visualization for it
and I and I actually almost never supported like many people’s patreon or
whatnot but I supported this guys cuz it was so good I’ll give you the link here
it’s the machine learning guide oh yeah I think actually I will throw it in
discord because I’m actually on three different computers and then I’ll maybe
multitask and throw it in this chat as well let me find it up here it’s OCD evl</p>
<p>00:17
machine learning and it was cool because I was following him while he was
building these podcasts and then you know he ended up getting a job and he
talks about his job and how much money you can make as a data scientist things
like that it was really good sorry I’m looking way up because I have a weird
setup right now it’s extremely weird but if you like podcasts this is the
de-facto like the best podcast that you you it’s kind of for laymen but not
really I mean it’s technical in nature but I think anybody that has basic math
background can follow along it definitely gets math intensive like a
lot of differential equations he doesn’t talk about the I mean we’re going to
make the to do all the work so it’s not like you
have to know how to do all these things you just have to know kind of what what
it means by doing this right so that’s all that’s all I’m saying about that so</p>
<p>00:18
yeah so this is me in a nutshell I basically I went through college mostly
as a computer science major then I switched to electrical engineering and
then I ended up getting some management degree got an MBA degree have a business
master’s I always worked in some sort of technical field but never quite like
pure engineering or pure computer program and it was always just a mixed
bag and jumping over to the corporate side the white-collar side of things I
enjoy the fact that I manage I manage the people that are technical
and and somehow I got very lucky to kind of skip being the expert in some
technical field and working my way up normally what you’ll see is normally
you’ll see other technical folks that are in the industry for a long time
their programming they’re doing really well and they’re listening to the p.m.
the project manager or the product owner
nowadays whatever it is and they’re they strive to become that they want to like</p>
<p>00:19
run the whole team right somehow I skipped that part and now I’m sort of
running the run on the show and it’s because I know the jargon I know the
lingo I know what this stuff means I know how to manage people and lead
projects because you have to talk to the business side the business stakeholders
and the technical guys and and trust me I’m sure all of you guys know this too
sometimes they it’s like talking Greek I guess or whatever the languages of
choice it is hard but that’s what I do and I love it it’s fantastic so I get to
steer and create contracts out of thin air that says hey I want to make my
organization better by doing some advanced text analytics right so I can
actually write the contract basically I’m not a Contracting Officer I’m not
I’m not anything like that but I do I do have a really high stake in writing
those contracts but it has to fit a business need always and that’s crucial you</p>
<p>00:20
a lot of a lot of people kind of steered away you know don’t get me wrong in
academia you can go any direction you want but if you’re actually trying to
work for a business you know everything costs money takes resources takes time
and then you have to convey this message to all of the people on the team you
have to convey it to all the leadership all of your organization yeah sorry I
was thinking it’s talking Greek like politically correct I don’t know thanks
for your comments everyone hey and you know what else to I will say this a long
time ago I created these C++ courses which I think maybe some of you might
have seen it but these courses I created
about 25 30 of them and they all went in a row so if you want to learn C++
they’re out there as well I’ll give you some tips on how to teach
and make a little bit of money online if
you’re interested as well I don’t make I
don’t make money off of this channel the art channel I think you guys know that
as well but let’s see I’m kind of all over the place now Oh C++ so I started</p>
<p>00:21
getting these comments right and I would teach a subject and then people would
just give me these amazing comments and I’m like this is that’s motivation to
keep going it’s it’s amazing when you actually solve someone’s problem like
you’re not just rambling about crap that doesn’t mean anything it’s straight up
you know you solved somebody’s issue you
in problem they love it and and I do the same thing when I’m on YouTube and I
find something that’s that’s worthy I’m like Oh finally someone fixed my problem
oh yeah is David Robinson he’s the one that does the to tidy Tuesday’s or the
say we got what wahlid talking about David Robinson he’s I think he does the
tidy Tuesday’s which is awesome he goes so fast whenever I watched him and I
used to I would put him on like one-fourth the speed or something to try</p>
<p>00:22
to keep up it’s awesome another good resource is any of the Kaggle Kaggle
sites which I should probably run run people through how to like clone the
Kaggle repositories in in are a lot of the stuff I don’t know until I check it
out too I might have done some of this in the past but it’s been so long I have
to catch up so but that’s why I wanted to actually be real with everybody to
let them know that hey as I learn it I’m
gonna teach you right I’ve done a lot of this in my masters course like I said
but it’s been so long I have to relearn it and it’s kind of fun to do yeah David
Robinson is pretty cool to follow it’s always good to find a good communities
yep yeah that guy’s so fast though I find that hilarious
let’s see what else workwise since I’m not in the I don’t actually do are now
there’s some people at my work that I’ve
run some visualizations and they do some</p>
<p>00:23
art programming I actually use it mostly for data manipulation or - yeah mostly
just to move stuff around on my own PC like for example I might have a rule in
Microsoft Outlook that says if this particular email comes in strip out the
attachments and do this and do that instead of using the outlook rules I
actually created some are that will go in there and do it for me and sort them
and or if you have to basically append you know 25 CSV files together I would
just do that with our rather than try to do it manually things like that I do
that all the time even unzipping files I think I just did an our video on that
that if you have a directory full of zip files how do you ends it them so I like
to use that I call that our for like practical
uses and I think that’s super handy one of my one of my most successful our
tutorials is the one where I scrape Twitter I think that’s the one that</p>
<p>00:24
everyone’s like wow this is great it’s fantastic so if you haven’t seen that
one you have to check that out it’s I guess I guess pretty good because it
gets to like you get to do a lot of things in a short short period of time
and it feels real you’re using real data not the empty cars and and I kind of
feel bad I’m not using like a practical approach to this so much for them for
the absolute beginners guide that I’m kind of building up I kind of feel bad
I’m not doing something that’s like you know worthy of like nobody wants to use
fake data even though it’s not fake data but you know you want to use some
relevant data I did some koba 19 stuff as well but I
think it was a little controversial I tried to put it on Skillshare they did
not like that they weren’t having it I was like but it’s not medical related
it’s data and they were not having it so I was kind of bummed out about that
because I put some effort into that one I think all of my stuff’s on YouTube by
the way so literally everything but I do so here’s what you do
here’s what I’m trying to do and I’m not very disciplined at it yet as you could</p>
<p>00:25
tell I don’t post as often as I should but you create these like 7 10 minute
segments in are right and you kind of make them back-to-back where you know
they’re in sequence you have to kind of follow the whole sequence put that on
YouTube then you take all that you bring it back and you edit it so that it’s
like just one continuous long stream maybe 30 minutes instead of you know
seven minute segments and you throw that on to Skillshare or udemy and you could
say this is a course now what what uh there’s nothing that prevents anybody
from finding me on YouTube and doing it for free but there’s so many people that
just want that structured course layout and they pay for it I don’t get many
because I’m honestly not trying that hard yet on there but Skillshare has
been promising if anybody knows any bit of programming skosh errors is pretty
good when I say that I literally had like a couple of recycled courses that I
took from my YouTube re-edit it slightly threw it on Skillshare and you know I
make like 30 bucks a month on skosh I don’t</p>
<p>00:26
never touch it never do anything with it yeah I call it deep liar I don’t know
what they really call it but deep liar - plier reminds me of a pair of pliers
yeah all of the tidy verse anything tidy is is definitely the way to go for me
I’m not the besar type at all 0% I’d rather just get it done if I want to
worry about efficiencies I’ll let the c++ or whoever’s gonna convert this this
research-based are to some you know the model that you’re gonna deploy in java
or something right look let the others handle that but you do have to start
thinking about as you get into the machine learn and you definitely think
about every calculation because you’re doing that calculation millions of times
and that it adds up it adds up greatly oh yeah the misconception about the
neural networks and the black boxes I forgot to answer that not a
misconception but people always say it’s a black box you don’t know how that</p>
<p>00:27
answer was there so I used to have a boss that would he’d be pissed that I
can’t just use normal statistics to come up with the answer and I’d say you know
I used machine learning algorithm right and it predicts and the models show that
it predicts at a you know eighty two percent accuracy right something like
that and he would say yeah but how did you get there I’m like it doesn’t matter
yeah in a sense it’s a black box as in it doesn’t matter how I got there
because the results speak for themselves you’ve checked the result if it’s
accurate attacker if it’s not it’s not how it’s accurate
I don’t know right but can you go in there and actually check every zero and
one in that machine and figure out what it’s doing sure you could you know it
could be hundreds of thousands of variables so no one would ever write
that down right but you technically could look at it and say this is what
the computer is doing this is what the models made out of but what you don’t
get because you’re on different Hardware you’re on different systems you have
slightly different code you have a different package version all of these</p>
<p>00:28
things you can’t recreate it a hundred percent the same way twice if you use
multiple you know hardware’s or systems or whatever right random seeds whatever
you did so that’s why it’s kind of a black box as you’ve just
I mean yeah you can recreate models but you know to a point there’s subtle
differences that’ll that’ll cause you’re accuracies will be still high possibly
but it could be a very different looking model if you looked at all the zeros on
ones basically is what I’m saying oh that’s great
oh you guys are hilarious cuz I’m thinking man I stumbled through that
kovat one and then here’s the thing about that COBIT analysis every time I
went to go grab the data they would change it from a CSV to a xlsx to an XLS
I’m like can they make up their mind and then finally I think after like four
little sequences I finally put it together saying hey look no actually</p>
<p>00:29
they came out with an are like API that you can use I was pretty stoked about
that yeah I agree I agree like for the most part I agree that most paid courses
are you can you can learn any bit bits and piece online for sure absolutely
sometimes people do like that structured structured deal that’s that’s great but
yeah everything is on there’s so much online it’s really hard to justify
paying for anything yet my work they would say oh you know but back at my old
job they would say oh we can get a subscription to this or that or that I’m
like I just google it like what do you mean I don’t need that just google it
why would you waste that money Stack Overflow is your friend like for sure
I’ll love Stack Overflow I quickly scroll to like the highest
rated comment or whatever read that before I even read the question I don’t</p>
<p>00:30
even read the question half the time I just go to the answer I don’t know if
you guys do that too but just go straight to the the first comment that’s
highest up voted if you want some good practice or good fun on Stack Overflow
just type in the letter R and then sort it by like most up votes and one of them
is how to reproduce your code there’s a lot of ways to reproduce your code and
we need to talk about that in in this tutorial as well
but it’s kind of a pain because building data frames from scratch can sometimes
take a long time so there’s a way to use function called D put D P UT that’ll
actually output a portion of your data frame as something that somebody can
copy and paste and it becomes a new data
frame I’ll show you I’ll do another I’ll
do a tutorial on that because it’s super useful for Stack Overflow and if you
screw up Stack Overflow you start posting bad stuff on there you’re just
gonna get a bad reputation so you got to really be careful with that Stack</p>
<p>00:31
Overflow but I do love it yeah and I decided to drink coca-cola today I’ve
been doing good until today so yeah I have a MacBook I have a PC that’s old
and I have a work computer so I have to struggle to switch my monitors between
all three PC or the two PC’s and the Mac and I love the Mac but honestly
streaming on the Mac with DSLR was less complicated because I was using
third-party software if anybody’s a mac hose using it was called cam twist and
camera live both great programs but it does tax your your computer pretty
pretty much makes it loud and a little choppy but I just got a capture card
literally yesterday so that’s what you’re seeing today is my capture card
and I will say if you’re trying to stream online if you want the good</p>
<p>00:32
quality video and have a DSLR I would totally recommend getting a capture card
if you buy one for about a hundred and thirty bucks I know for some people that
could be way too much but for for me it was fine but the one thing that you want
to do is make sure your quality of your audio is good I hated when my fan was
running so loud and I had to edit my my audio for you guys I had to put like
this noise remover on there and it distorted my audio a little bit still
better than most though audio is probably much better than good video but
screen capturing is easy enough anybody with OBS
which is free online broadcasts system anybody with OBS can stream or capture
their own screens so I recommend it try it out start a channel if you want to
even teaching are like like I’m doing you know just start out if you teach it</p>
<p>00:33
you learn more about it so there’s that with my channel the our channel what I
hope that you guys find useful is the fact that it’s just are there’s nothing
else on there right except for this occasional thing
it’s literally just are so you can’t get lost in the weeds you stay on that
channel you’re gonna stay on our one thing I want to add and I’m going to add
soon is I’m gonna start interviewing people that actually use are in industry
so I’m gonna reach out and have like a 25 minute interview with them talking
about how they got to where they are in their careers how much are they actually
use things like that some lessons learned so that’s coming up I’ll have a
whole playlist on just that I’ve got maybe four people lined up so far but
still haven’t actually done the interviews so but I think that’ll be
really fun a lot of people want the real world answer to what’s gonna happen if
you actually learn this stuff how valuable are you I wish I knew all the
answers to that but I don’t so that’s why I’m gonna start interviewing other</p>
<p>00:34
people that actually do this I try to stay up to date with all this stuff but
it’s definitely difficult when your everyday job is not our or data science
some people would call me or others that aren’t you know getting our PhD and
there’s stuff citizen data scientists that’s the buzzword around the Gartner
conferences and these big data analytics conferences is they try to sell it to
you as hey anybody can be a data scientist you know you can use tableau
you can use whatever I actually I barely do anything with data at work like I
said I just manipulate move move files around things like that
sometimes I’ll append multiple Excel files like one handy thing I had to do
recently was well not too recently but I had maybe 20 Excel files with each of
them had like 15 tabs I needed all the tabs to
appended to each other so I can look at it that way so I just did that with our
there’s like an XLS X package or something</p>
<p>00:35
it’s a package for everything yeah that I love I love using the our packages
when they are available makes things a lot easier but again when
we get into the actual hard core more machine learning every little
calculation counts so well we’ll have to
be careful what we use like C++ you know I remember sticking we had a I think we
had 32-bit computers so one integer would be 32 bits so one integer would
take up 32 so one number the number seven would take up 32 bits on that in
the RAM right so those 32 bits I was actually in C++ cutting that into pieces
you know 8 16 24 32 I would stick 4 pieces of data in that one integer slot
and then I would use calculations to calculate what I was storing later now
it takes up CPU cycles but it doesn’t take up much space so if you you know to</p>
<p>00:36
store for it would be 32 times 4 but I stored 4 numbers within that same
integer value and the same thing goes for a 64-bit machine one integer the
number seven takes up 64 little bits but in today’s times none of that actually
matters storage is cheap and it’s abundant but it is pretty funny that you
know I went from thinking about that to you know load all the packages you want
you know the computer can handle it so it’s good stuff
but yeah I just wanted to give people a little insight on what I do on the side
I stream I try to teach how I do this I have another channel it’s just under my
name so you can find it it’s mark Ginn grass and that channel I actually teach
more about how do you use Final Cut Pro to edit these videos how do I make my
art videos how do I get the audio better how do you stream so I’m just starting
to build up something there and that one is monetized by the way so let’s see</p>
<p>00:37
Zaki says my professor in the u.s. uses our and machine learning for analyzing
geographical data love to connect and with you oh yeah
that would be Oh that’d be awesome building a community like that where I
can interview someone that uses it that’d be fantastic I’d appreciate that
definitely I do have a I literally just started it yesterday so it’s gonna be
pretty thin but I do have a discord I think I pasted it in there let me see if
I could do it again and we could start talking in there a little bit more
actively more and we could be very open about what we talked about doesn’t
matter I don’t hold anything back by the way let’s see like especially money and
all that stuff if you guys want to know about how much money my channels make</p>
<p>00:38
that’s totally fine let me see if I can catch up here switching to Python oh
yeah well in our studio I don’t know if you’ve tried it you can you can actually
run some Python through our studio which
is kind of nice you know how when you do your chunks of data in a markdown file
you do the R chunk you could do a Python chunk and it’ll grab you a Python
interpreter and run the Python code it’s kind of cool
there’s a package called reticulate I don’t use it but ret I see you will
reticulate there’s a package called reticulate that you might be interested
in if you do Python I’ve learned Python a little bit and then I stopped then I
learned it a little bit then I stopped I did try to do some tensorflow with with
Python as well I heard tensorflow was going out the was
actually not the de facto standard that people wanted to follow anymore I heard
PI torch was taken over yeah I would love to do the interviews with anybody</p>
<p>00:39
you know that’d be great or even anybody learning I think if we can just
structure the videos and the interview to be value-added we’re you know we just
stay on topic I think that would work I think people generally don’t know
what’s next in life without having to know you know no one’s
buddy how do you know somebody that’s in the field without you know oh wow
geospatial data the only thing I’ve done with our was create some density plots
in the US I took some FDA data for tobacco products all of the enforcement
actions are public data so if if a kid was gonna buy cigarette at a retailer I
could get the I could get the address of that retailer and like what was the
infraction right so it was like sold to a minor sold to a minor what I was doing</p>
<p>00:40
was I would take that address and I’d plug it into the Census Bureau API they
have an API where he can send an address and it gives you back coordinates and I
would use those coordinates to create a heat map of where all the infractions
were in the US it was pretty cool and that was I forget what it was
plotly maybe I forget but that was pretty cool I enjoyed that I’d love to
learn more geospatial things in our and I love the fact that our is pretty
dynamic where you can in it you can interact with the graphs a lot more than
you used to be able to did you guys all notice that our went up to a 4.0 so if
you want to upgrade your are you can get our 4.0 I don’t know if that’s a good
thing or a bad thing yet I haven’t run into problems yet but again I’m just
kind of dabbling here and there absolutely but I try to stay current
with it all if it breaks a break so I’ll just revert it back you can also have
multiple versions of our I don’t know if
you’ve noticed that but in your settings you can just click on the our version</p>
<p>00:41
you want so if you have 4.0 you can downgrade back to 3.6 whatever you want
to do but don’t but your libraries or your packages usually have to be
basically in that 4.0 folder to work under our 4.0 so you might have to
redownload a bunch of packages it’s not a big deal usually yeah well this was
fun I’ve been on for about 40 minutes still I’m just glad that with only like
a 10 minute lead time people actually showed up to this section
I’ve never done this before where there was people chatting this is great
I love the interaction I definitely want to get your ideas and I will start
building up this discord and taking it more serious and maybe we can connect I
think it was Zakir that said he has the professor that I can connect with yeah
hopefully we can find each other after this and make it happen let’s do it the</p>
<p>00:42
hard part though is trying to figure out how to record somebody on the other end
in high quality and have it all synched up I think I’m good at it now but every
day it’s a new struggle it’s funny like I do with my friends and it’s just like
what else can break like how many things
can break the the very first couple I’ve
done it was me and a buddy and he was in Chicago I’m in Washington DC the very
first one we we just recorded our own self and then we sent each other the
footage to sync it up and that worked pretty good but you can’t really ask
anybody to do that so but there are ways there’s tons of ways yeah yeah the
geospatial stuff is cool I know in the u.s. the census the Census Bureau has a
an API you can call up to like a thousand addresses per whatever
timeframe and it’ll give you back all of
the coordinates I’m kind of all over the place um reading comments and then just</p>
<p>00:43
answering them again I have my the weirdest set up right now and it’s
driving me nuts so the rest of the day I think I’m gonna try to clean up some of
these wires I have a really good desk set up video by the way I think you guys
will like my desk I’m not gonna lie but it doesn’t look like the video anymore
because things are scattered everywhere it’s nuts but if you’re interested in my
other channel by the way on how to make videos I’ll send you that link right now
why not since I’m here and I was talking about I was talking to my friends about
like what do people think about you oh wait what do people get wrong about you
right something like that we’re doing like some weird corn
team thing and one of the things I said was oh I think that people don’t think
I’m funny until they get to know me then they think I’m really funny and every
one of my friends were like no no you’re</p>
<p>00:44
not funny I’m like damn that’s messed up that’s pretty funny I thought I was I
thought I had some good jokes here in there but I guess not so yeah check out
that reticulate package in our studio and there’s so many good Python
tutorials out there - oh that’s great hey I’m glad that you guys like this
I’ll definitely do it again and I’ll see
if I could bring a guest on this as well cuz I I’ve been learning a lot about
streaming like and how to do that of course with my new PC I should be able
to do it better but I’ve learned how to use OBS where OBS itself is a it looks
like a webcam so that’s pretty pretty awesome so everything should work out I
will do this again for sure and I’ll bring some people on and hopefully I’m
gonna crank out some where our videos like that are relevant and make them
more practical with real data let’s start doing that I appreciate you guys</p>
<p>00:45
coming on here and sharing and spreading the word and every time I did ask I
think I feel like I get new subscribers all the time not that often but I will
be monetized one day with this our Channel probably maybe three or three
months from now if it picks up a little bit more my goal would be like three
months from now and monetizing will get me so my the channel that I just posted
on there I’m only making like anywhere from 30 to 55 per month on that channel
I don’t put much effort into it so I figured that if this channel gets
monetized I’ll probably make another forty fifty dollars a month on this too
so it’s all gonna add up yeah Jupiter notebooks are good I need to jump on the
Python bandwagon but man there’s only so much time it’s great
I love Python because every single industry uses it there’s no doubt about it</p>
<p>00:46
like if you talk to about what they’re mostly coding in its
like Python Python nobody’s gonna say our R is good for like research
statistical analysis college but yeah I think I think a lot of people are still
on Python although ours getting better and it’s in
it’s growing they’ll be curious to see what happens in like four or five years
I haven’t dabbled with anything else I go the go language I haven’t touched
that I don’t know what else is even out there right now but all right guys I
appreciate it and we will do this again for sure I like the fact that I had
people on here now I’ll actually advertise it much sooner next time and
come up with a good topic and maybe a guest so alright and if you haven’t
joined the discord even though it’s gonna be pretty pretty slow at first
it’d be nice to start building a community with you guys in it to help
and I will see you guys next timeEnd of file</p>
