welcome back last uh tutorial we talked about multi-linear regression
and some p-values and i was telling you if it's below 0.05
it's probably significant if it's greater than 0.05 it's not
of course all dependent on the use case but you know that was pretty cool and we
just kind of randomly guessed at which variables or features we wanted to
include but now we're going to do something a little bit more
um programmatic and and we're going to go from there so
so let's start with our empty cars so we're going to say my data
is equal to empty cars as usual and just to take a quick peek
at the data we have this and what we have here is features across the horizontal
and that's the miles per gallon cylinders displacement horsepower
drat weight etc etc so we have all these things so how do we know

00:01
what might be correlated with something else right or what what's definitely not
correlated now this is just one measure remember everything you do
in statistics all depends on a lot of circumstances
i am literally just giving you some ideas on where to go now scatter plots are
good you can do a scatter plot and see if something is related to
something else like like we've done with the gg plot so
let's do that one more time just to get a refresher
so we'll just do we'll include the library ggplot 2
and do a quick plot so let's just do a gg plot we're going to say
that our oh well first let's bring in the data my data
and we're going to use aesthetic x equals miles per gallon y
equals weight this is just a pure example okay we have that
let's add a geometry to it so we're going to add geom point and this is

00:02
literally just to get us back in the game we haven't done this in a while all
right so we have let me unzoom this so now you can see
on the bottom right you see a it looks like it could fit a linear line almost
obviously not because all the points won't fit on the line but you can kind
of draw a line and the line is going downward so it's a
negative slope so mods per gallon of weight might be related sort of linearly so
we'd expect a correlation between the two if the miles per gallon is high
the weight is probably low the most per gallon is low
the weight is probably high okay so let's do this a little bit more
programmatically or just kind of get a different view of this using something
called correlation a core or the pearson's correlation
you can find all that uh you're gonna have a lot more of that coming up
so let's start by calling a correlation of we'll call it my core is equal to

00:03
and it's a base r function so core and it's literally put in your data my data
command enter and then just let's just type in my core
and hit command enter on that you can see down at the bottom here
maybe once i figure out how to there we go so we scroll up
and it looks like a bunch of numbers and you're like what is all this
right what is all this so we have miles per gallon
cylinders displacement across the horizontal with miles per gallon
cylinders and displacement across the vertical you can see that
miles per gallon is 100 or one correlated with miles per gallon
miles per gallon is correlated with cylinders negatively
by 0.85 miles per gallon is coordinated correlated with displacement by negative
point eight four now these numbers mean something right what it usually means
well what it means in a lot of cases is that if it's closer to the

00:04
to the number one it's highly correlated if it's closer to a negative one
it's it's exactly oppositely correlated et cetera et cetera so numbers that are
in the middle are really not that correlated
but this visual here is not that good it's a lot of numbers in fact it doesn't
even fit so there's two more features on the bottom here that didn't
fit over to the right so let's let's see if we can
get a little bit better picture of this and i'm not going to explain exactly
what the pearson correlation is uh doing yet because sometimes it's going to
haunt us but we'll get there just just a moment
so now that we have this we're going to load a library called
core plot and another library called our color brewer to help us out with
aesthetics so let's do packages install and we'll just do core plot
install that one by clicking on install and then r

00:05
color brewer install that one i just installed them
uh recently so i don't have to do it again but you can
and let's go and load those libraries once you have them installed so
core plot this is real easy by the way but it's just a real cool way
to display correlations our color brewer will load that up
and now that they're loaded let's use them so we're going to create a core plot
so that's why we have library core plot core plots are really cool they're
really interesting and they're really aesthetically pleasing to the eye
so we're going to bring in our data which is actually we're not going to
bring in our data we're going to bring in our correlation data so the my core
we've got the my core right there we're going to bring that in
and then we're going to say hey what type do you want well i'm going to do
type equals upper i want my upper side to be shown
at the lower because as you saw in this matrix below
it shows everything twice if you actually look at it closely it's really
hard to even see but it's actually mimicked twice along
the diagonal is all you need is either the upper diagonal or the lower

00:06
diagonal get into some matrix algebra and you can figure out some of these
eigen matrices you can you can do it a lot with this but for now we're going to
keep it extremely simple when you type equals upper we're going
to say the order is equal to the hierarchical cluster h clust and then
we're going to use the color brewer to have that over
color is equal to and then this is just yeah you could kind of memorize this the
brewer palette that we're going to be using
and we're going to say we're going to have eight colors and we're going to
use a a predefined color palette named rdy u right so it's hard to
you can look these up in the color brewer package say hey
what are the some of the color packages or predefined packages that are already
there so let's see if this works i probably have an error ah nope i figured that
there's a comma h cluster i don't need a parenthesis there
boom and i think i need one here i think that'll do the trick
there we go all right cool we got a nice looking chart here let me zoom in

00:07
a little bit here now that is much more aesthetically pleasing to the eye
am i wrong so what we see here is uh we have carb carb related to carb
carb related to weight and you know there's a a legend here see this
the one up here the very blue is extremely correlated so
obviously carb is rated to carb they're the same thing of course they're
related 100 related so of course you can explain carbs
with carbs so think about this explainer variable thing again
that we did with linear regression we wanted to explain things with something
else but now if you keep going down the list let's look for some
extreme red so these negative ones right so these are pretty red right here this
group here right here so miles per gallon see that red and
weight remember we said that they were negatively correlated and it kind of went
it sloped down so you can see that here miles per gallon
is red and weight over here weight in miles per gallon you've lined those up

00:08
you're extremely negatively correlated i don't know what the number
is but we know that it's very red so it's definitely closer to the negative one
that's fine so we can possibly describe if we had an equation it said hey
whatever the miles per gallon is multiply it by some factor and flip the
sign and you're good to go it's correlated right so you can you can imagine you
don't have to guess so much on what's correlated with your
uh linear multi-linear regression so when you're trying to get that equation
of that model to predict you can look at this
first and say well maybe i'll include miles per gallon because that looks
pretty heavily correlated horsepower seems correlated cylinders seems correlated
with miles per gallon but then you can even go down here and
of course miles per gallon is correlated with miles per gallon
uh one to one right but quarter second mile yeah there's some correlation there
because it's you know but it's closer to zero so it's not going to be as helpful
probably right now this is not foolproof this is not foolproof that's

00:09
one key thing you have to know um sometimes things are
extremely correlated but they have nothing to do with each other just for some
odd reason they're correlated but they actually don't have anything to do with
each other and secondly sometimes um things that are not
looking like they're correlated can actually have some significant um
correlations in the long run or predictability patterns
right but this is really a a stepping stone to get to where you want to go
and that's all i wanted to show you was this cool little palette and what they
mean highly correlated versus not highly
correlated there's a lot more to it than this
so you just don't use this at face value all the time but it's a good start you
know because we did predict in the previous tutorial that miles per gallon and
weight were correlated and you can see it's very big and it's
very red so that tells you how it is all right well i'll see you guys in the
next episode hey thanks for watching my tutorials
some of you who have left some really good comments below
some of you guys have liked it and shared your stories with me and i

00:10
appreciate that keep them coming i definitely want to
continue to do this sometimes it's hard to pick up where i left off
and i might get sidetracked but i assure you that a lot of this will be relevant
to the previous tutorial as much as possible so if you haven't started from the
beginning of all these different beginner type
tutorials please go ahead and check them out again like
comment and share this and i hope everyone stays safe in this
environment we're in today [Music] youEnd of file
