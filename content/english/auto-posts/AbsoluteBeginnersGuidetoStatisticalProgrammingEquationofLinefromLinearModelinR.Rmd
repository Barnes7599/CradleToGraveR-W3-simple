in the last tutorial we spent about five minutes because plot in three points
weight and heights on a graph and we decided to figure out what the best
linear model or straight line fit would be to go through those three points as
close as possible while minimizing the error and the error is the difference
between the point on the line itself and the point itself let's backtrack and
just rerun all of this code here so we created the data frame with our data
points we loaded the library ggplot2 and then we went ahead and plotted it with
the confidence interval and the actual the line the blue that goes through the
points as best as possible right so let me zoom in on that real quick for you
and what I want to show you today is how to get the equation of this line now
when we get to models that are more complicated we're not going to do this
think about it as we get some very sophisticated models in the future we're

00:01
gonna have tens of thousands of variables right now we have basically
one variable we have the weight depends on the weight what's the height right
easily done by a human by hand but I just want to give you the confidence
that this is actually predicting the correct line bichri creating the line
itself so let's go ahead and let me zoom back out of this Oh before I do that
before I do that let me show you one thing that we have to fix this blue line
as you see it goes all the way across if you look at the X scale you'll see that
the scale doesn't actually go to zero and I kind of need that for my example I
want it to go from zero to some number may be 225 zero to 225 right so between
100 and 125 that's only a 25 unit difference right you can definitely tell
that to the left of that 100 I don't have 425 units to get down to zero so
we've got to fix that let me show you how to do that real quick first and then

00:02
we'll go from there alright so in our GG plot we've set up all of the parameters
that we need except for one thing let's set some limits for our x axis so x lim
and we put that in parentheses and we say hey give me a vector or atomic
vector of numbers to show you start finish I want to start at zero zero
sounds good and we'll finish at 2:25 so now let's
rerun this and you will see and it's changed let me zoom in for you on that
now you see if I finish this line if I kept on going straight it's going to
keep going keep going keep going and it kind of maybe hits I don't know
somewhere around here is my guess but I don't know we're about to figure that
out we're gonna extend that line is what we'll do all right
we're not gonna extend it on the code yet we're just gonna do it manually so I
wanted to show you that just so you don't get confused with this next step
all right so we want to find the coefficients of that of that equate of

00:03
that line so to do that it's very simple first let's create a model look say hey
this model one because we might do multiple models maybe there's ten models
we want to see which one best predicts the data
remember this was a linear model though we didn't actually capture what the
linear model was we just piped it into the guchi plot so let's go ahead and
just do a linear model and we're gonna say what do I want in it I want my X
data my example data I want the response variable to be weight right I want to
predict the weight based on my oh no no no let's go be the way I want to predict
the height based on the weight so I will do a tilde and do the same thing X data
dollar sign wait I don't know why it's trying to auto populate all those other
numbers but we don't need those okay so we have the tilde thing which is new for
you guys probably all it's saying is it's just more syntax it's saying hey
here's the predictor variable based on the weight
I'm predict I'm gonna say I give you the weight tell me what the response is you

00:04
know if I have a hundred pounds what's my height if I have 200 pounds what's my
height that's all that means just get used to that so do a command enter on
that and now you have the model saved as
model one and all we're gonna do next is find the coefficients coefficient of
model one and it's gonna tell us down here below we have an intercept of 24
and a weight of point it's not a weight it's it's kind of a bad choice of a
variables but the the X data wait wait so is wait wait is 0.24 in other words
every time you have some sort of weight multiplied it by 0.24 that's our slope
that's our slope and I'll show you how that works in just a moment so let me
switch to my my other camera let's move this aside and let's do a
little bit of manual calculations just to get this through to you okay so we

00:05
said that the intercept was 24 so the intercept is also where it intercepts on
the yeah where it is intercepts to vertical axis so if this is weight and
this is height I'm just going to abbreviate with H when the weight is
zero down here when the weight is zero I know that it's gonna cross because R is
telling me it's gonna cross 24 I know there's a point right here on that line
mostly because it was given to us it says the intercept so the intercept was
equal to 24 and it said that the it didn't explicitly say the slope but the
M is 0.24 the slope is actually its it's a weighted amount that you multiply the
weight by to get the actual height plus the intercept let me show you a better
example the old equation that we all probably don't remember anymore is y

00:06
equals MX plus B remember the B is the intercept that that 24 is that B the B
is where it crosses the vertical axis and the M is the slope of our predictor
variable so this X is not really an X that's the weight this y is not really
the y that's the height so we can change that to a more height equals some sort
of slope times the weight just do W plus
some intercept which we know is 24 right so the intercept is 24 height equals
some slope times the weight but that slope you don't have to think about it a
slope think about as a weighted away did parameter right so it's not M we
know it's not M because it's telling us based on the R that is point two four
it's a point to four times the actual weight now using the word weight is kind
of hard because you can also count this point to four as a weight I'm waiting

00:07
this other variable W by 0.2 four so that's a little confusing and I know
it's hard to see that so let me let's just plot one more point that we know
this one here because if I plug in zero for weight and I multiply zero by 0.2
for you still get zero and zero plus 24 is 24 so again if the weight is zero
bring it all the way over right here I plug in zero zero times 0.04 plus 24 is
equal to 24 so the height is 24 does not make sense right because it's just a
model it's not real life so this is some of the things we have to fix in the
future now let's pick an arbitrary another one let's pick well 100 we know
that at 100 wherever that might be that if we plugged in 100 for weight and
this is just an approximate I'm gonna say that's 0.25 so 1/4 so 100 times 0.2
4 is approximately 25 25 plus 24 is you know 49 so when the weight is 100 you go

00:08
up to about double this right so there's another line or another point
and there's our line for our actual model those aren't the real points we
know we know that when the weight is 100 that the height is 45 because it's in
our data but that doesn't matter it's whatever's on this actual line right
here that matters I hope that kind of makes sense to you
guys so we created the line let's go back to our plot and just double check
and it all makes sense so we have right here it says blue line goes all the way
down if you kept on going I kept on going I mean I'm kind of bad at judging
where that goes but it's probably somewhere here right which would be
under the 25 mark so maybe 24 right that's exactly where we just did it on paper
and at a hundred you can see that the line itself is at forty nine right and

00:09
the actual dot if you go back to our data the actual dot if you look up here
is at forty five so when it's hundred its forty five so I was a little off
because I didn't multiply about point two four and because it's not truly
going to contain those data points it is the best fit line that minimizes the
error between that line and the data point [Music]End of file
