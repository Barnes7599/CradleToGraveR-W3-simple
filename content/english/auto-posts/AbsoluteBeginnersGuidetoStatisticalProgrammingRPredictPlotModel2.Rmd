welcome back to cradle-to-grave our if you haven't checked out cradle-to-grave
are.com please check it out it's a good way to find an organized set of
tutorials that I put together for you so it's just a little bit more handy than
sometimes going to youtube or other venues for my content so check out
cradle-to-grave our calm today we're going to talk about
more predictions and linear models but this time we'll plot some new points on
the same line with a different color so you can kind of see what the prediction
is just to give you a little more insight on what's going on and I think
you'll find this a little bit easier than previous tutorials because you've
already done this once before I'm just gonna expand on what you've already done
so let's start off with like I always do I want to start off with let me zoom in
here I want to start off with an example data so e^x data I'm making this up as

00:01
empty cars my favorite data set right so
command enter let's take a quick look at that I'm going to click on the actual
example data here you'll see it's got 32 rows of data and
about 11 columns alright so we're gonna deal with miles per gallon and
displacement so what we're gonna do is we're gonna predict the displacement
based on the miles per gallon we'll just see if we can do that right so let's
close this out now that we have our variables of interest our VIP very
important parameters we'll get there eventually now so what we want to do is
first let's first draw a scatterplot right so we'll need our library ggplot2
let's load that in and let's just go ahead and first create the scatter plot
so we can get a kind of visual of what's
going on so we'll do ggplot and our data

00:02
is going to be equal to our example data right and what's our aesthetic we have
aesthetic we want to use miles per gallon and displacement so the X is
going to equal miles per gallon and the Y will equal our displacement all right
so we can't finish there because we don't actually have
geometry so let's add Geum our favorite one to do and just go ahead
and command enter on that you will see once I get out of the way boom you will
see that the scatterplot has been created I'll zoom in for you just a tad
and you know you can kind of see that there might be a possible linear
relationship you can kind of draw a line diagonally down here maybe somehow so
that's what you can expect when we create our linear model for this let's
find out let's find out not one way to do that remember is to actually add a
Jeon so plus geum smooth and what's our method our method equals linear model so

00:03
done deal just as predicted what do you know we have our linear model with the
gray band being the confidence interval so there's a 95% chance that the average
data point that's added to this will be within that interval so that's what that
means all right so let's let's focus on ad and more data to this plot just to
see where they would line up but first we need to create that data so let's go
ahead and do that let's say more data hey I've got some more data I want to
check out I want to predict my new stuff based on the model that you created so
based on the model we create we want to be able to plot the new stuff in fact we
didn't actually create the model yet we plotted it don't get me wrong but we
didn't actually save it anywhere we plotted it with a GM smooth method
equals LM so let's just do that first let's first save our model will call
that model 1 and we call it model 1 because we might have five or six
different models to play around with and eventually we're gonna see which model
is the best one so you might cycle through multiple models with different

00:04
ways to predict okay so our our model one or linea model one we might do other
models we might want a predict displacement based on something else
let's go back to that real quick what if displacement in miles per gallon
were not as correlated as we thought and we decided that displacement and weight
were more correlated uh we'll check that out maybe right so that's why we have
multiple models this is model 1 and we're deciding we're into a linear model
and we're going to base our middle idiom we wanna we want every risk we want to
figure out the response variable which is displacement by the explainer
variable which is miles per gallon we think that displacement is is explained
by miles per gallon and what's our data equal to so our data is equal to example
data and then we run that and now we have a model once stored we can use that
model what are we gonna use it for well we're gonna use it to predict the future
so we have the model which the model doesn't show us a whole lot we can do
coefficients remember modeling to square one boom you have a 580 point eight

00:05
eight intercept that's where it crosses the vertical access which looking at the
plot if the plot actually went down to zero on the x-axis I could see that
right it's not quite we didn't set our limits to show that and then of course
the miles per gallon slope see how it's negative negative seventeen point four
to remember in y equals MX be days back in algebra two or algebra one a positive
slope goes up and to the right a negative slope goes down and to the
right right so this one's going down as you as you go to the right it's going
down so it's a negative slope it's a quick way to kind of do a sanity check
anyways that being said now that we have a model we have a model that we can use
we know the equation but we don't really need it because we have our do the math
for us let's create some new data now you have a vehicle that you've never
tested before and you want to call it more data I have more data I'm gonna say

00:06
hey I have a data frame because it's got to be the same type of data so data
frame and data frame would work well together
you know vectors and vectors work well together so well create the data frame
the data frames only know miles per gallon it's all I got I knew what their
mpg was and I'm gonna set that equal to a list of numbers so let's say we have a
twenty two point two miles per gallon we have a twenty seven and we have a I
don't know let's go thirty two right we have these new data points but we only
have miles per gallon we set it into a data frame so let's command enter on
that so now that is stored our more data is three observations of one variable
you could see that right here so if I click on that you'll see it's just
one parameter miles per gallon or one feature and it's got three observations
close that out and what are we gonna do with those well we want to figure out
the prediction on what would you predict the displacement to be well we could do
that and we are going to do that but we n do it with data first so I'm gonna

00:07
call it you know I'm gonna call it predict one to follow the model one so
model ones first set of predictions is going to be equal to remember the
predict function so predict and what do I want to predict let's see what do I
want to predict well we need to bring our model in so we we can't predict
anything without a model to use to predict so we bring our model in and all
we do is bring in our new data so here's
a model that was created you could store that model anywhere you can save it to
the desktop you could send it to your friends you send it across the world
people will be able to use this model if you send it to them they don't have to
know the underlying data they just know that that model contains everything you
need to do to predict so that's just one way to look at it but our new data is
and it's on this new data equals straight-up
more data that's it so command enter on that doesn't show you anything but if I
type in predict one and we watch the bottom screen here you will see that we

00:08
have three new displacements so displacement one is 193 110 and 23 so
they correspond with 22 27 and 32 so if you have 32 miles-per-gallon your
displacement is 23 according to the model that we're using that we created
based on the data that we had which is a linear model it's a very simple linear
model we use that model to predict new outcomes new observations now let's go
ahead and plot that so we want to plot that by if we go back up if you take a
look at our GG plot up here we've already done a lot of work up here let's
not repeat that let's not copy pace and all that good stuff so let's just call
this our plot underscore 1 and set it equal to this plot so I'm going to do
command enter on that to rerun it so now a plot 1 is stored over in

00:09
my global environment you know its plot one right here list of nine you can't
really tell what it is by clicking on it you'll see like this this mumbo-jumbo
you won't understand it quite yet but so model one is I'm sorry the plot one is
or GG plot that's stored but now I can reuse plot 1 so how do we do that let me
scroll down here so we can just say plot 1 let's do this plot 1 if I can get my
type into work is gonna be assigned plot
1 so it's assign it to itself right plus other things see how I'm doing that so
it's like you know you repeat it plus I'm gonna add a geometry what geometry
am I gonna add I want to add my prediction geometry so I'm going to add
another geometry geom point this time I'm gonna say data is equal to more data
but my y-axis for my aesthetic I don't you can put your aesthetic inside of

00:10
here and my aesthetic I'm gonna say Y is equal to the predict 1 values and let's
just go ahead and make the color equal to red so we can really see a stand out
let's see if this works so now you have to actually type in plot 1 because I
just stored it as plot 1 so let's just retype it in and there we have it let me
zoom in for you and I'll bring it over you have these three little red points
which I can zoom in a little bit more you see two of the three on the screen
and right here is about 20 of 24 this one's about the 27 and then there's a
third one I don't think you could see from there it is so there's a third one
down at the bottom see those three points now notice they're all on the
actual line right they're all in the blue line well that's what we expect
it's a linear model so it's just a straight line so in order to predict a
new value you have to pretty much run across that line it's got to be
somewhere on that line now is this the best prediction I don't know we haven't

00:11
figured out ways to measure how good this prediction really is but I wanted
to show you again how to run this through with a different data set so you
get a little bit experience a little bit more more muscle
memory for it but then also to actually show you how to plot those three points
on top of the points you already have so you can get a better visual you know it
might not make any sense right so you want to get a good visual all the time
let me zoom back in on this one more time let me give you the example of not
making sense and I haven't looked this over yet but just as an example look at
this red dot right here notice there's no other dots inside of this band I mean
there's almost nothing there so maybe there's some sort of weird you know BAM
that they just will never exist the only way to find out what this red dot truly
would be is to go out and say hey I'm gonna do a mile per gallon of whatever
that is twenty two point two two and I'm
gonna see what the displacement is based on whatever speed they they run it etc

00:12
etc and if the point though the displacement they get is truly equal to
this red dot awesome your prediction worked very well your model worked
really well which allowed you to predict if every single time you ran this test
though none of these red dots were close then maybe your model is off and it's
not predicted very well but we'll work on that will create more complex linear
models and their coming tutorials if you haven't please subscribe and it
would really do me wonders if you share this across social media tell people
about it and check out cradle-to-grave are.com I will be making that a more
aesthetically pleasing site where you can go in and have all of this very much
organized so thanks and leave your comments below let me know what kind of
questions you have and I'll try to answer them you [Music]End of file
