all right we’ve been talking about this r-squared stuff so I might as well give
you some mathematics for it it’s real simple if you really break it down into
its component parts so r-squared is a statistic that we use to measure a
models fit so how do we assess the accuracy of a model the way we’ve been
doing it for the past couple tutorials was using the R squared statistic today
I’m gonna show you how to actually calculate that statistic using the
longhand form that’s to a point anyways at least give you the logic behind how
you calculate it you will be able to calculate it after this quick little
tutorial so we’re gonna do that because we want to have kind of a like you know
we want to have the big picture of what’s going on we don’t have to know
the math behind it but if you’re gonna use this as a measure for your models
accuracy you should kind of know what’s going on at least a little bit right so</p>
<p>00:01
that’s what we’re gonna do today and the equation for it is equal to TSS which
I’ll explain what all this means in a second but let me write down what it is
divided by TSS minus RS s divided by t SS which if you do a little basic
manipulation t SS divided by t SS is equal to 1 so 1 minus R SS / t SS so
however you want to remember it is fine what you want to do is figure out what
all this stuff means right so what is t SS it’s the total sum of squares that’s
what they call that right so another way to write TSS you can do it in this
format you could say hey this like a draw correctly the sum that’s a
summation mark the sum of all of the Y eyes minus the average Y that’s what</p>
<p>00:02
that little bar means squared right so let me break this down for you now what
does this mean so the Y I is the eigth predictor think about it you have some
sort of equation like y equals something right you have these regret regressors
on the right hand side and here’s what you’re trying to predict the y
so the weii is the eighth prediction right the outcome the real value though
so if I’m on the fifth row and I say hey plug in your values for all the
regressors what do you get for y that’s what that is
that’s the exact answer so if you have some sort of plot with all these dots
you know and then you have a a estimated model a linear model that goes straight
through like that your actual value for that first or that
particular dot that Y I so this might be the I write on the x-axis that
particular dot is that number and then you’re gonna subtract the average of all
those dots so the actual number here the actual number here the number here the</p>
<p>00:03
number here here and here all divided by the number of occurrences I just said
out loud is the average so you’re basically saying hey how far off am i
from the average for each every single point how far off from the average am i
square that number that way we don’t have negatives and positives and that’s
what that is that’s the TSS right so we’re gonna worry about the RSS and the
TSS we we know how to figure out the TSS
now literally add up all the Y’s all the Y values divided by the number of Y
values to get this y bar or the average or the mean of all the Y’s everything
that you want to predict even though we have the state at the data is here it’s
not a prediction it’s real okay so you have the TSS now what is the RSS
our s is equal to the summation from I equals 1 to N of the actual the actual Y</p>
<p>00:04
value minus the estimated Y value so the a little hat Y hat I squared so this is
similar to this TSS but it’s RSS so what’s the difference let’s look at it
this way TSS right it is the actual numbers I
mean there’s no guessing here you have the actual Y predicted value or you have
the actual Y value for every single occurrence you have that why that why
that why that why and so forth you can calculate the
actual average of your training data set because you have the data you can
calculate the average this is no joke real it’s not fake it is absolutely
correct that is what TSS is and of course the same goes with RSS except we
have some assumptions here this Y hat remember the Hat is an estimate so it’s
an estimated right so what would you estimate so you take the actual value
the Y I which is right here remember that’s the Y I your estimated value well
here’s your linear line here’s your linear model that you just</p>
<p>00:05
drew that value is actually on this line so take that value the top one subtract
it from where it would be on the model that is your predicted square that so
there we have it right so we’re think about that you’re gonna do that for each
and every one of these find the variability and you’re gonna do the the
basically they’re predicted divided by the actual and that’s how you get your
r-squared remember we were getting numbers like point seven four zero point
eight one and the higher the R squared which makes sense if you’re predicting
took a look at here if you’re predicting a better result let me pause frame here
because I said something that wasn’t true so I’m gonna tell you what I meant
to say so as the RSS as you can see as the RSS
gets a better prediction in other words if your Y hat value is closer to your Y
I value then of course that numbers going to be smaller and smaller and at</p>
<p>00:06
that number smaller and smaller look at the ratio between RSS and TSS as RSS
gets smaller and smaller that that fraction becomes a smaller and smaller
decimal so you’re gonna be subtracting one - that’s smaller decimal which will
get you a higher r-squared ultimately I hope that makes sense and I’ll unpause
it now now there’s a caveat to this you know the more features you add now this
is a simple example with just one regressor but as you add more and more
predictor variables it becomes more complicated but we talked about why add
in more and more variables or features to predict or regressors to help you
predict the y and it can be a bad thing because it adds complexity and it
doesn’t gain you a whole lot the example that a
lot of things we’ll a lot of literature will tell you is you know if you have TV
adverts advertising and you add radio you get a big increase in your sales
right so hey you can kind of predict that right you add radio and TV you’re</p>
<p>00:07
gonna get a bit big increase but then you add newspaper and newspaper just ads
maybe like point zero zero zero zero one percent more sales
so what’s newspaper really needed for that model because I mean there’s so
much variability and there’s so many ups and downs and fluctuation fluctuations
you might want to keep the models simple and just use TV and radio why add that
third variable of course when we’re gonna deal with like real world
situations you know you dealing with like lots of variables tens of thousands
of variables they really get complex pretty quick you don’t want to have
extra variables if you don’t need them hello our community a little side note
here I create these videos on another channel and I show how I do it and I
want to show you guys just in case you want to also create this other channel
that I have and maybe you’re interested in it first of all thank you for
supporting my our channel and I appreciate that a lot
so in this channel this is my my name mark Jin grass just YouTube just look up</p>
<p>00:08
that and you’ll find me I teach how I actually teach are and other things like
C++ programming or anything in general how to use a green screen how to use OBS
how to do it with a MacBook or a PC how do I embed myself inside of that our
studio how do I quickly make my workflows better so I can switch between
screens instead of edit in post-production using Final Cut Pro so
as you can see I have OBS streaming tips and tutorials I have Final Cut Pro tips
I have content insider how much money do I make
how do I make money what am i doing what am I doing wrong then of course you’ll
find some other tutorials that you might find interest in because you’re also
programming so VBA C++ some computer tips in general and of course much more
supply chain in forecast and you’ll find it all so if you appreciate my are
videos and you want to learn how to make videos like that maybe you like Python
or you use the go language or you have a C++ course you want to teach
check out this channel I show you how to actually monetize and try to make money</p>
<p>00:09
with it and I try to be real with everybody I’m only making about 50 bucks
a month on YouTube hopefully when you guys subscribe and like and share my
videos on our hopefully it’ll turn into a hundred and that’ll be a pretty good
deal for me so as you can hear my fan on my computer is malfunctioning right now
and I have to replace it because it’s way too loud for using this blue Yeti
mic so those are some of the struggles and they’re real again I appreciate you
guys helping me out [Music]End of file</p>
