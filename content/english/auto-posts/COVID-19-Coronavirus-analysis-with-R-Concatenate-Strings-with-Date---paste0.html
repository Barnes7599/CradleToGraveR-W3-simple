we’re going to continue on with our kovat analysis however I am on vacation
so the audio is not going to be great and I’m sorry about that in advanced so
the previous tutorial I showed you how to collect some coded 19 data and
there’s a URL and what I’m gonna do is we’re gonna check to see if this URL is
still valid because the date has changed is no longer 3/8 so I’m going to copy
this we’re gonna go to a website and we’re going to just paste it in to see
if this is still valid we checked and you can see down here that it downloaded
an XLS file now let’s go ahead and change this 8 into a 9 or a 10 or
whatever date is in the past or currently so let’s just go ahead and try
a number 9 and hit enter and you see that it’s downloaded the 9 the day 9
data so we know that this pattern is good so we can use this pattern to</p>
<p>00:01
collect the most current to date that is out there so let’s go back to our our
code and instead of using this particular URL we’re gonna build a URL
using a couple of functions this will be
a very short tutorial but I want to show you how to update this automatically so
instead of URL 1 equal in this static string we’re going to actually make this
into something more than static so first
let me show you a couple things let’s go down to the console let’s type in the
word sis dot date and then open close parentheses you’ll see that the format
happens to match what we exactly see right here except it’s got the current
date 20 2003 14 so that can help us what we’re going to do is we’re going to put
this into a paste 0 function which will basically a pendant or concatenate
strings so let’s go ahead and do paste 0 over Fritzie and we know we want all of
this information up to the actual date so I’m going to close the parentheses</p>
<p>00:02
right here I’m sorry ID quote here I’m gonna hit karma and then I’m gonna
actually just delete this part I’ll rip the dot and I’m gonna well let’s let’s
put XLS in quotes and then we’ll close the parentheses
we’re missing one thing we’re missing the actual date so let’s put that in
right in between which is right here and we can call sis date here so this will
append at the system date this first part of the string and this XLS
extinction let’s see if it works let’s go ahead and rerun this entire thing by
hitting the play button now of course we don’t know if today’s date I didn’t
check it was actually uploaded but there’s no errors there so we’ve run
that now let’s just go ahead and run our sum
looks like there is data because 50 408 and we can do whatever we did last time
so now check our DF right here we have all of our dates</p>
<p>00:03
we have 3:11 here so it looks like this is working just fine so very quick
tutorial but I want to show you how to make this more dynamic instead of static
so now you’ve learned system date you’ve learned how to concatenate user base 0
and I hope this will help you with your analysis [Music] you [Music]End of file</p>
