today I'm going to talk to you about how to extract data from a CSV file using
our and doing some outlier test and actually extracting that data now I
created this and as I build these tools I want to explain to you how to use them
but not necessarily each line by line because I'm I'm not very proficient with
are yet but I'm building tools that might be usable so I want to share them
as fast as possible as I learn them I'm going to tell you more about it though
so here's my excel file it's a CSV file it's a it's called read CSV located on
my desktop as you can see I have a lot of columns all the way out to letter V
with blah 1 through 19 or whatnot all this data is random I used a random
number generator to produce it what I'm interested in doing though here's my
problem that I had to solve today was I had to take just the a 10a data all the
way down to the CCI were changes to see right here what I wanted to do is I
wanted to take all that data now I'm going to take a certain column which was

00:01
blonde 19 column and say are there any outliers and if there are can you get
rid of them for me but I didn't want to just do that with the ATM's
hey I wanted to do that with each one separately 810 be at 15 CD and so on and
so on all this data is random don't forget so let's let's go ahead and look
at the our code and see how I did that or at least I'll walk you through
quickly I'm gonna walk you through but I'm not gonna give you the details so
first I remove all the variables I like to start off with a clean fresh slate
when I load my data now here's something
that's crucial is this in this quotes is where your dad is located it must be a
CSV file what's the syntax that I use in the packages that are loaded um the one
thing you want to be careful for when you paste your own in there is make
these forward slashes when you paste it in from windows it's gonna look like a
backslash like that you want to change them all to a forward slash then you can
run it okay then I do some stuff and one thing here is the only one that I've

00:02
actually implemented so far was the a zero one zero a this is still a manual
intervention after still write down each
one that I want to extract and then what I would do is cut and paste this data
for each lon now there's ways to automate that but I wanted to give you
what I have so far okay so here's the function called
about Liars well it does it takes in a vector it looks at all the na s all the
divided by zeroes spits the throws them out and then what it does is it finds
the interquartile ranges and it finds the outliers based on some statistics
based on the interquartile range you can read through and kind of follow it and
see this basically arranged it's 1.5 times the first and third quartile
anyways it's all stats for you okay so next is extracting the SRT rate which is
nine SRT that was what it was before I put that random generator in there this
is actually the BLA 19 column so extract just the blend 19 column is this code
here on 43 and I made it to a new variable this is the new variable it's

00:03
confusing the way I named these because they're subtly different like this is a
10 a and this is a 10 a underscore SRT so be careful with that as you go
throughout this code basically this is how you extract a single column from a
data frame so one column from the entire data frame if you have 25 columns you
want to extract one that's the notation and the syntax to do it okay now you
might have done that you've extracted it but it's still not a vector so I can
bring it to a vector using line 46 I'm sure you can combine these into one line
but this was my learning I had to do this today and then I wanted to test
obvious outliers so I actually inserted at the very end of my data to known
outliers like 234 is an outlier in 55 Snell era I noticed because my random
number generator only went from was 0 to 5 so I know that these are obvious
outliers and if it doesn't get rid of those and you definitely know
something's wrong with this code okay so when you test yours find out what your
data should be around and then throw some sort of outlier in there just to

00:04
test it of course delete these two lines
when you're done but just to see that it works okay so this cuz printed out what
my layers are I'm gonna run this in a second I'd produce a box plot to show
the outliers and then my clean data is equal to you then I call that function
removed outliers and I bring in my vector and that's what does it returns
from the vector it'll return the clean data and then I do a box plot on the
clean data and then I print out the clean data data let's go ahead and run
this and show you what it is so I highlight the whole thing I click
run you're gonna see a bunch of stuff you see my box plot let's look at the
original box plot by clicking left okay so you can't even see the box these are
such big outliers right so that looks like the number 55 there and that's 234
right there obvious outliers let's get rid of them and look at the box plot and
boom your box plot goes from 0 to 5 just as it should and then my bulk of your
data is gonna be in these ranges here okay so let's look at the data real
quick while we're at it so the clean data let's look at the original data

00:05
first actually so this is the original data and you can see the 234 and the 55
are in this data set here in this vector the clean data is down here and it is
gone so I know it's a lot and there's a lot of confusion with some of them
nomenclatures I've used for these variables but I wanted to throw this out
there so again all you have to do is change these change this to your file
name as long as it's a dot CSV change this to the column you want to separate
out different variables 8 10 8 15 they're all mixed together let's
separate them out and that's about it and you can obviously change the name of
the variables and use this and get rid of the end the data I hope that helpsEnd of file
