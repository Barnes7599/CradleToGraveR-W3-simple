The first part of the project will be to duplicate what I have scraped. Once you have successfully completed that step, you are free to explore more sites to scrape.

Remember, not all sites are equal when it comes to scraping content. There are numerous hurdles to overcome. However, this project will get you in the right direction for collecting data in many different forms.

Attached is the code used for scraping. Your project requires you to modify the URLs and the html_nodes parameters to scrape your own unique site.
