00:00
for this quick tutorial we're gonna circle back and fix this data table to
make it a little bit more aesthetically pleasing as you can see it's got too
many rows to show in one view and it really doesn't have any functionality
that's too useful if you want to export it or something like that so we've been
using cable extra which has actually got a lot of really cool features to
creating tables but we're gonna create one called
DT data table so let's install that clicking on the install button a package
called DT and once you install that just click on install and it'll install the
latest version I already have that version about restarted anyways once it
installs we're going to replace this cable function with a data table
function so let's get rid of cable extra and we'll just type in the word or the
characters DT for data table and running that we can run the line 62 by command

00:01
enter or control enter if you have a PC now we have this our reduced
EDF that we had a table we're gonna get rid of this entire line 68-67 and we'll
create instead we'll create a data table and inside of this table we're going to
bring in our reduced EDF and we're going to bring in some parameters extinctions
equals and we're going to type in buttons and we'll have options that will
be a list and finally we'll actually include some
buttons with a vector of strings we want to be able to export to all of these
formats and you don't have to memorize this because once you do it once you can

00:02
just copy paste you can see which ones you like and it go from there so this is
a typical data table let's run that and it ran clean
now don't forget ctrl s to save it this is gonna be a short video we're gonna do
our markdown and render and we'll type in our script SC RI PT 1 dot R Z and
let's see what the output looks like okay let's go to files and I believe a
script window in V dot HTML this last one here view and web browser and I'll
bring it over take a look let's see what we have so you scroll down you still
have your code that shows there for transparency now we have this a little
bit cleaner table with page nation or pagination however you want to say it
well you can actually set these parameters to you can have 50 or 20 or
100 whatever you want you can set that in another parameter but you also have

00:03
these really Oh in the highlight see how as I move the mouse it highlights the
actual row that I'm referring to and you can sort pretty easily sort by day sort
by date sort by deaths that must be okay and you can do a search as well so
if I wanted to search for say you know I
know what the problem is is when we were in the our code before we actually only
took the first 100 rows here so we don't really need to do that anymore cuz we
fix that problem so let's get rid of 966 as well and instead of using our EDF
we're just write up use EDF we'll get the full data set in there so EDF let's

00:04
rerun this chunk it should take just a second and we'll re-render it I do it
every time I forgot to save it command s then render I told you I do that every
time and I get baffled every time by it now I could be able to open in web
browser and we have 656 pages and now we
have a lot more deaths which is not good but our tables a lot cleaner but now we
also have this copy CSV Excel all that good stuff up there if I want to output
this to excel or PDF you just click on it and it should as long as you have the
appropriate software installed it should actually export for you there we go so
there's our PDF file right here so it created a PDF for us just took a minute
because the PDF is actually 140 pages long that's it I wanted to show you how
to create a better looking table and tomorrow we will look at better plots

00:05
because this plot is just not going to do it for us so don't forget share this
on social media subscribe and I will see you in the next one [Music] you [Music]End of file
