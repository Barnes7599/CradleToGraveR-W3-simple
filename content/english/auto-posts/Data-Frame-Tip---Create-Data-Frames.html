we previously just plotted our awesome data right here and we decided that we
have a gender male and female we have their ages as factors and we know that
there were exactly two people that are age 23 one male and one female of course
you can’t have one and a half people but we can fix that another time but this
was a introduction to how to do some bar
plots we talked about count and identity now I want to show you just how to
organize slightly different when you create in these data frames so we have a
data frame and we created it on the fly like this we put every piece of data
inside of this data frame function to create the data frame object what we
could have done was we could have said straight up that people is assigned a</p>
<p>00:01
column we’ll call it a column a column called Dave Jackie and we’ll make this
short because I just want to show you something here a little tip so there’s
people and then there’s age we can assign age to a another column whatever
the numbers are doesn’t matter but they have to be equal to the number of data
above it and then of course our gender we could have done it this way there’s
so many ways to do the same thing I just want to give you an idea of how to do
this male female and male so what we have here is we have three different
vectors or columns so we can run those three command enter on all three they’re
all going to be here but their atomic vectors they all contain the same data
type inside of them so these are characters these are numbers these are
characters so then after you create your
people age and gender what you can do is</p>
<p>00:02
you can create a data frame this way you could have said data frame assign it to
a data frame and plug them all in like like so people comma age comma gender
and it essentially does the same exact thing our data frame did not change we
still have people age and gender here and that people are aligned with people
age is aligned with age and so forth so it’s just a little bit cleaner or a
different way to organize your data because it can get pretty messy if you
try to plug it all in to that function at onceEnd of file</p>
