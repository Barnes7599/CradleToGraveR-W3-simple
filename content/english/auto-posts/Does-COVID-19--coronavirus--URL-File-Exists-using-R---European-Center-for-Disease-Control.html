all right every single time I try to update this Cova data file they change
the pattern of the URL and it’s driving me a little bit insane
so if we go back to once again the European Centre for disease prevention
and control site click on publications and data scroll down to the download
link well guess what today if you look closely it’s an XLS file and not an XLS
X file this has been causing a headache we
tried to make this dynamic a couple of times and now old code is not going to
work old videos probably don’t really work if
somebody’s following this so if you’re at this video you can go through the
five tutorials but know that this one fixes yet another problem so what we’re
gonna do is we’re gonna make the URL a little bit more dynamic this is actually
gonna be a pretty cool tutorial on how to dynamically check to see if a URL is
actually in existence or not this can help you with a lot of different things</p>
<p>00:01
in the future the first thing you want to do is if you don’t already have this
package installed is you want to pet you want to download a package called our
curl our curl so install that by clicking on the install button and then
as you can see here on line 13 for me is the library our curl already loaded up
ok so you want to put that library or curl in there alright so basically
here’s our problem let’s break it down this way we have URL one that we’re
pasting we tried to make it dynamic by saying ok system dot date is what
changes so we append the date in between this string for this file not a problem
but the extension keeps changing between
XLS and xlsx so we basically want to try each one and see which one actually
comes up with the file on the Internet itself
so we’re not gonna worry too much about it quite yet because I’m gonna show you
a function that’s gonna help us with an if statement if file exists use it if it</p>
<p>00:02
doesn’t use something else all right so we have everything here and remember we
had this function here called read xlsx and sometimes if it’s not xlsx ID be
read underscore excel so a very confused and very tedious so let’s create a
helper function here so we’re gonna go I’ll put most of this code in the
description somewhere all right let’s do a helper function we can do it right at
the very top let’s start with line 15 and I’m just gonna cut and paste it and
then I’ll walk you through it because it’s kind of a lot it’s not hard though
and we’re gonna modify it some more all right so look at I’m at line 15 I’m
gonna paste it here and hopefully you can see it all so all the way from line
15 down to 31 is what I just pasted now I got this code from a blog I modified
it slightly so far because I’ll even put</p>
<p>00:03
the name of the blog here where I got it we’ll put that as a note so I got it
from this site here and it actually had some syntax errors but I fixed them but
other than that this is where I got the code from all right here’s what it does
URL exists is going to be a new function
that we’re creating and this function is gonna take in an address the address is
whatever we want it to be well it’s going to be the URL all right so it’s
gonna try and then if it doesn’t work it’s gonna do something else so it’s a
try-catch statement you haven’t learned too much about that or any at all so let
me walk you through it though the first thing it’s going to do encapsulate it in
this bracket so between line 17 and 22 and it’s hard to read that’s a whole set
of instructions that it’s going to try and if it’s successful it’ll do it if
it’s not successful it will move on to the error mode so to speak so it’s gonna
try to make a variable called connection
based on our address it’s gonna do a URL
address and then it’s going to read that and close the connection basically hey</p>
<p>00:04
does this exist yes or no and that’s what the our curl functions do if it
doesn’t exist then we’ll know and we’ll get a false so basically at the end of
the day you’re gonna get a true or a false you don’t have to actually know
how this entire thing works but we wanted on the line 16 now and hit
command enter and run that function so the function didn’t really run cuz it
just kind of put the function in memory so we can use the function now so on
Lions 29 can you scroll down a little bit on line 29 now I have
if statement if the URL does exist and then I give it your all one which is our
URL up here remember actually it’s down here so we got to make some
modifications if it does exist print out
URL exists simple as that right so let’s change our code and try something out
here they’re gonna move URL one copy all that and I know that this might be
difficult if you’re just joining us in this tutorial but I advise you to go
back to the previous tutorials to catch up all right so we have URL one above</p>
<p>00:05
that so we know we can run that let’s go ahead and run line 29 so command enter
ok URL 1 is loaded in memory and you can see what it is right here not the whole
thing we can actually type it in down here so URL 1 hit enter it’s got the XLS
on there ok now I said if we go back to the site if you hover over it it is XLS
so it should exist so this should print out URL exists let’s try it out so the
if statement is if URL exists which calls this function URL exists and in it
like I said this function returns either true or false
so we should return it true because we know it does exist and it should print
this out so let’s try it out so let’s do line 31 command enter and next line and
you’ll see at the bottom here and my console it says URL exists okay now
let’s mess with it a little bit just to break it on purpose let’s add the X in
this URL so command enter now now our URL is not that it is now with the X at</p>
<p>00:06
the end right here so now when we do exists it should print nothing so if I
do command enter on line 31 or 32 you will see that there is no printed of URL
exists on there so we know that it’s working at least in this case that being
said let’s get this thing working for this site relatively quick here now so
we’re gonna do just a couple things we have euro 1 okay let’s keep your l1 as
xlsx let’s simply just copy this URL paste it right underneath it and change
it to URL 2 and let’s change this to an XLS no X
right same thing with this get statement here we’re gonna leave this B for a
moment so we’re gonna say if the URL exists get it right and we’re gonna set
that as a temporary file we’ll do all of our stuff in there I think I think</p>
<p>00:07
that’ll work let’s see so if your L exists your o1 instead of doing that
we’re gonna say so copy or cut this let’s get rid of the cat
although we can keep it there let’s just do a command V on that let’s just say
xlsx XL s X file exists and then it’s gonna actually get based on your l1 it’s
gonna write it to disk TF so I’m just worried about this temporary file only
being local inside of this function so I’m slightly nervous about this working
tonight we’ll see so if it does exist to go ahead and get it and if it does get
it let’s go ahead and read using this function command X and paste it in there
so we have euro 1 URL - and what we can do is we can basically just copy this</p>
<p>00:08
command C command V now let’s do URL - if your l2 exists we say XLS file exists
URL get the URL - and the extension in URL - is XLS without the X and we have a
different function called read underscore Excel so we have two
functions or two if statements let’s run
this and see let’s in first let’s delete our variables over here so we have DF
here let’s just go ahead and clean that up delete everything start from scratch
alright let’s run this right now let’s see what kind of errors we get no errors
that’s always good and we have DF right here now that works just really well we
don’t know if the other one will work yet because right now how we’re dealing
with XLS so tomorrow when the CDC European CDC changes to XLS
we should be caught up I know that was a lot to handle so what I’m gonna do is
I’ll keep this code for you you can just copy paste it and kind of follow along</p>
<p>00:09
with what it’s doing mainly though it’s this URL exists function that we’re
using to get back a true or a false statement before we start doing other
types of data gathering [Music] you [Music]End of file</p>
