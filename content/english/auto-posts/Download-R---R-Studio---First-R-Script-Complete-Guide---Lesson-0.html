hi we’re gonna download our into our studio and I’m gonna get you started on
your first couple of scripts really basic but let’s get right to it so just
go to Google and click on download R or type that in you’re gonna get the our
project the our project so you can go straight here or you can go to most
likely if you’re using Windows it’ll show up on the top left as a download
option here or Mac whatever it should default to it so just click on this
download R for Windows usually the latest version is gonna be up in this
box and just save the file open the executable and go through the steps I
didn’t see any bloatware or any spyware and it’ll install R now don’t worry
about our just yet because we’re gonna download our studio as well so let’s go
to google and type in download our studio and it should be the first link</p>
<p>00:01
our studio comm products download so it’s very easy to find so download our
studio as well and you’re gonna get to this page and the free version let’s
just go ahead and click on that and you can click either one the whatever’s free
is the one you want to use same deal that’s gonna open up a link installers
so I have window so I’m gonna click on the Windows version and save it run
through the steps if you need to pause this video come back to it when you’re
done okay okay so once you’ve downloaded them both now they’re not gonna just
show up as Start menus most likely so you’re gonna have to know how to
navigate to them go to your Explorer whatever way you do that so File
Explorer click on your C Drive usually it’s C Drive local disk whatever that is
it’s going to be under Program Files if you have Windows and you go to Program
Files gonna see our and you’ll see our studio</p>
<p>00:02
both okay so our is just going to be we’re gonna use the back end of our and
all all of its features but we’re really going to use the the IDE the our studio
so this is where our is located it’s under our sixty
four-bit and you can click on our you’re gonna get to your command prompt it’s
very basic command prompt you can do things like two plus two and there it’ll
give you four we’re not gonna use this this is going to be very difficult to
write scripts in unless you’re somewhat of an expert but so let’s get out of our
and never think about that for a while let’s go to our studio and let’s create
a link to it so our studio you go to your binary and you go to your down at
the bottom it’ll say our studio Exe what I did was I just dragged and dropped it
to my taskbar so I have a shortcut route didn’t read it I don’t know what I</p>
<p>00:03
clicked on there anyway so our studio I just click on our studio and it opens up
my workspace my environment my integrated development environment so to
speak what we have here is we’re in the console window that’s basically the same
exact thing is that Dass looking Cronk window
we’re global environments to the top right that’ll store all of our variables
and their values and I’ll show you that more in a minute plots packages all the
different things down here you’re gonna see navigation panes let’s get started
right away so like I showed you with that DOS prompt looking thing and if you
could enter on twoplustwo it’s gonna give you four right notice nothing’s up
here but if I said a equals two plus two now we have a variable called a and the
value that’s stored is four so if I just type in the letter A and hit enter over
here it’s going to show you the well it’s gonna print out 4 here and that’s
that okay now we don’t want our work so much
inside this console area so let’s go to file new file our script</p>
<p>00:04
control-shift-n it’s going to open up this notepad looking area this is kind
of you the place that you want to store your scripts or your code so you’re
gonna have multiple lines you can repeat them and run them multiple times so let
me start by giving you a comment this is a comment it will not be executed no
matter what so let’s do the same thing we’re gonna do two plus two we’re just
gonna hit enter you see nothing happens because it’s just like notepad highlight
that line or get to that line with your arrow keys or Mouse hold
control if you have a Windows hold command if you have a Mac and hit enter
then you’ll see it populated the console
down here so you can repeat steps 2 plus 2 8 plus well let’s do 8 plus a we have
a variable named a so let’s try that so that should be 12 right hit enter or
ctrl enter I should say and we’ve got 8 plus a is 12 well let’s make 8 plus a</p>
<p>00:05
let’s store that in to a variable called B so B equals and hit control enter
now B equals 8 plus a so if I type in B control enter it’s gonna equal 12 every
time right plus I decided to change it and I actually do I can do B less than
symbol - and say let’s make that equal to 0 control enter and now we’re back at
0 so if I if I do now I can go back and forth to the console oh there’s some
testing I can just type in B and C it should equal 0 at this time right
because if you look up here on the top right a is 4 B is 0 right now if I want
to rerun parts of this I can just highlight it and it’ll run just that so
it showed displayed 4 and then it made B
equals 8 plus a so B is now if I go down to the console these should be back to
12 see how that works now if I ran the whole thing B is going to equal 0 again
because at the end of the day B is going</p>
<p>00:06
to equal 0 you can also do it this way B
I’m sorry 0 and store it into me I don’t use this method very often but that’ll
work too let’s do a different number so we know if it works ok let’s let’s do a
10 ctrl enter and now let’s do down here
at the console let’s just type in B okay so there’s your 10 how do we how do we
remove these variables I’m gonna show you that real quick and then one more
thing and we’ll call this one good so we’re removing by doing the RM remove
and we will type in list equals LS currencies close mercies
okay now they’re all gone now I want to get you this far so you can start
googling and kind of understand how the syntax works and how the layout works
here one other thing if you do the question mark at the console and then
you type in RM it will give you all the help features which I’m not gonna go</p>
<p>00:07
over what all this means yet but that’s how you would get to them for now Google
is going to be a friend I’m gonna show you one more very useful thing about
this to get you started with more of a real-world situation is what if you had
your own CSV file or excel file that you saved as a CSV comma separated value if
you have an excel file with headers and you want to save it and you want to use
it in R the easiest way right off the bat without downloading any packages is
to just convert that into a CSV file because R really likes CSV comma
separated values no extra fluff in there so I have a file that’s located on my
desktop let’s go to file explorer now I was gonna say you can just go straight
to your desktop and copy and paste the URL in the address bar but with windows
and everything it’s not that simple so let’s go to our local disk C Drive and
start from there I’m gonna go to users Canton is where it’s under and then</p>
<p>00:08
desktop okay so that’s where my file is located is desktop and it’s called test
dot CSV my file is located right here so
what I’m gonna do is I’m gonna copy this URL or this address that’s now an
address and we’re gonna go up here to our console I’m gonna erase all this
because we don’t need it we need to read dot CSV open parenthesis and you should
see well let’s let’s start back read dot CSV and now just let it sit there and
you see this yellow box pop up that kind of gives you an idea of what kind of
parameters go inside of that function so they’re read CSV it’s pretty
self-explanatory it’s gonna read a CSV file into our studio what’s the file
that’s the first parameter and then these other parameters like header
equals true those are all optional at this point I’ll get into more
later on with some more tutorials so header equals true that’s a default so
if you don’t put anything in there it means there’s a header in there if you</p>
<p>00:09
don’t have a header just make that a capital false I’ll show you that in a
second so let’s go ahead and put this in there so if you have Windows you’d put
them in quotes and paste that URL in there and then I’m gonna show you how
this is not gonna work first test dot CSV
it’s very finicky it’s gonna read those back slashes as escape characters so
when I hit ctrl enter you see the error down here so that’s an error and it’s
telling you basically that hey back slashes are used for special characters
and it doesn’t recognize them as back slashes so make those forward slashes
like I think most other operating systems we do automatically max even
worse max has some weird funky stuff going on with layers but I’m now if I do
that I’ve entered there’s my database it showed up and showed headers and it
showed the actual data and it numbered the data with the rows so what are we
gonna do with that we’re gonna actually store that as a variable say my data
equals that control-enter now you see on the top right my data two</p>
<p>00:10
observations of three variables what are the three variables name state and city
two observations observation mark that an observation day of that row so that’s
how you read it in there you can you can do many things with with this like if
you names my data and it’s gonna spit out if you hit control enter the header
name so that’s kind of nice but if I wanted to select say header the city
header one knows the third one so I can do names my data and you can use this as
an array basically or a vector and you can just put in the number three in
there and it’ll print out city and you can make that equal to something as as
two so city header whatever you want to use it for equals okay so you see down
here you have a value called city header and it’s called City these are just
examples I wanted to get you started to where you can actually read a file of
your own to make this more useable to you feel free to comment any questions</p>
<p>00:11
and I hope to put some more of these tutorials out laterEnd of file</p>
