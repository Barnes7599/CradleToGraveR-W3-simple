scrape or download data from the web using our programmatically import the
data do a couple of calculations create some variables analyze it just slightly
show the death rates and we'll make a data table we'll create an HTML site
that you can actually publish and an actual plot that you can look at and
make it somewhat interactive where you can at least show the code if you want
to to be transparent or not so this is for anybody that has no programming
experience yes there's gonna be things that you don't know and you'll have to
play with in Google however if you just follow my lead
you'll get to at least play with the data enough to get an understanding of
what's going on I think anybody will find this useful without any program and
experience whatsoever that being said the first two criteria that you have to
have is you have to download our let's just called are just type in download

00:01
our and it's free online and then download our studio next download our
studio after you've already installed our so as you can see on my screen here
our version three point six one is the version I'm using you should download
something very similar and again install our and it will do nothing except do
stuff in the background for you then download our studio which is what you
see in front of you here this is my console this is my
environment where I store variables into RAM and here is where I can store files
or or get two files see my plots download packages we'll get into all
that in a second so that's step one step two we're going to create a new project
so we're gonna go to file new project and we'll click on new directory and new
project we'll give this a name called Co vyd underscore nineteen
anything you really want to call it just make sure you know where you're saving
it I'm saving it on my desktop it's not that important yet or during this

00:02
tutorial but it will be in the future if you continue with your our journey so
create the project and you'll see nothing's really changed except we're
actually in a project so we have certain directories set and things
like that but don't worry about under-the-hood stuff yet now we want to
create a new are markdown notebook file I like the notebook files because their
inner they're a little bit more usable so click on file new file and this time
we're gonna go all the way down to our notebook so click on our notebook now
you see all this pre template stuff here we can get rid of all of this so let's
just highlight from all the way down from line 18 all the way up to 6
we'll keep the actual Yambol code at the top so that that's called gamal code
it's yet another markdown language so don't worry about it it's something
that's going to be rendered into an HTML file later let's go ahead and just
change the title though so keep the quotes but we're gonna call it you know

00:03
my first Kovach analysis whatever you want to call it and we want to have the
output as the HTML notebook that's what's gonna give us a little bit more
transparency and ways to give it a narrative all right so we're not
actually coding yet we're just gonna put a little bit of markdown language first
to describe what we're doing the first thing we want to do is probably put a a
header saying hey what are we doing here with this website so with that we would
use hash tags 1 hash tag is like a head and one in like Microsoft Word so you're
actually creating a head and you can't see it yet because this is just markdown
language but that's what that means so I'm gonna call this check out my co ved
analysis what I do want to call it right then you could type in more words and
say you know this is the approach I use I got the data from and now it's

00:04
important to cite you source from this source right and we can do we can
actually put code in here so I connected
OOP : now to put the actual source first I'll show you the source that'll help a
little bit so let me go to the website and I'll obviously give this to you so
this site is the European Centre for disease prevention and control and I
have the URL here I'm gonna copy that that's what I'm gonna give to you so
don't worry about memorizing that if you
scroll down just a little bit though you have all these download links and you
have a download in CSV you have all kinds of download links I'm gonna put
their generic page here though I'm not gonna go directly to the CSV just
because it might update but I think this page might be pretty stagnant now if by
chance this page is no longer there I actually have the data stored on my
personal website which I'll also link so
you could still do this tutorial whether
or not this site is still up and running or not so I copied that and we're just
gonna put it here will actually do the yellow code so to do that I'd put it in
brackets so open and close bracket and in the bracket you want to what you want

00:05
to be spelled out so European Center for Disease Control prevention whatever the
acronym is I'm just making this up and then directly after the bracket you put
an open parenthesis and a closed parenthesis and you can put in your
actual website without any quotes so I'm going to control-v or command-v on that
depends if you're a Mac or a PC this does work for Mac and PC so same same
scenarios now don't worry about what that looks like just yet but no that's
gonna be like an interactive link that you can click on when you build your
actual webpage cool we've got the source now let's actually get some code going
so let's do another header and say import data so in this section I'm going
to import data so we can say we can also cite a source here too you know or we
can just say this is where we import data simple as that
now we're done with the markdown language we're gonna use some actual our

00:06
code to import this so to insert an are chunk which is to tell this when to
actually interpret something as code you can do alt command I alt command I what
I switch between a MacBook and a PC and my shortcut keys are just terrible right
now because of that anyways you see these little back ticks here these are
not the apostrophe that's to you you know your pinky finger it's not that
these back ticks are the number that will the character to the left of the
number one on your keyboard most likely so those are back ticks so three back
ticks followed by this bracket far bracket curly brace I should call it and
then end in by three back back ticks you can see even change the color on my
integrated development environment my IDE the our studio so I know in between
these is where my our code goes now how do we start this well luckily if you go
back to the site if you scroll down you'll actually see download the data in

00:07
more formats we're not trying to download this manually we want to do it
programmatically lucky for us they actually provide a script for
downloading the CSV file into our software so simple as this we're gonna
copy from this little hash tag look at thing all the way down to where the data
is so copy from here down to the data command C or control C and they kept
this little hash tag and I'll tell you what that is in just a moment let's go
back to our so in between here on line 15 I'm going to do command V and you can
see I've pasted the code in here now that little hash tag right here just
means because it's inside of the our chunk now it's different from when it's
over here where it's our markdown language I know it's a little confusing
but just bear with me here the hash tag is just a comment within the code
because you don't actually have to have all of this this is just optional
alright so we have this code we don't actually have to know much about it
except for that it does read the CSV file which is a comma

00:08
separated value basically an excel sheet columns and rows into my our studio for
me it's nice that they have that however you might run into problems so the
problem they gonna run into is on line 16 and 17 you have two libraries library
utils comes with the are so when you download it are itself you've you've got
that you're all set now HTT TR does not come with base are what you downloaded
so we have to install that package so what we do is we go over here to
packages click on packages click on install and then you'll see this dialog
pop up and you just want to type in HT to TR and then make sure that it says
repository cran here and I would not mess with the default that comes with
the install to library directory here don't mess with the default unless you
really know what you're doing with our and make sure install dependencies is

00:09
checked because if this particular library HTT TR which is a helper it's
gonna help us do our work might need other helpers and it'll automatically
download those helpers that HT t gr needs in order to work so then click on
install I'm not gonna install it because I already have it but it should take
roughly depends on your connection less than 30 seconds most likely okay so
that's installed and then when you do that what you want to do is this little
play button over here to the right it says run current chunk you'll want to
use that to run the entire chunk that chunk of our code that would just create
it so I'm gonna click on it and you'll see this little green bar on the left
that means it's executed those those lines of code if you have a red bar that
means there's an error somewhere so if you get an error at this point you
should sit back and try to figure out what went wrong
did you actually install the package was there an error it really should run
smooth but if you did run it to something

00:10
there's troubleshooting that's probably not really part of this tutorial so but
what you see over here in the global environment I have now two variables set
I have a data and I have a TF now the TF is a temporary file but
again we don't have to worry about it because that was given to us from the
actual site so kind of ignore that it's just a temporary location to store
information before you decide to save it
permanently anyways the data it shows us right here we have 80 304 observations
so 80 304 rows of data and 10 variables 10 features 10 columns if you click on
data luckily this IDE gives us a display of what the data looks like so we can
kind of get a handle of what it looks like before we start playing with it and
messing with it so let's just recap what's across here we have the date rep
whatever that means probably the date recorded the day the
month the year I'm not interested in all of this data right now but I'm just

00:11
going to walk through it we have cases deaths the countries and territories Jie
GE old that's probably some standardized way to abbreviate the country country
territory code same thing population data 2018 but we're not gonna focus on
that we're really gonna focus on cases and deaths in this it is now on you to
figure out and go back and research what all these mean this is a very simple
tutorial let's X s out and remember though these are all low case and it's
cases deaths countries and territories I'm going to close this out and let's
continue down the road now so this appeared but we don't need it you can
either exit out or you can just click on line 24 where those ticks are at the
last line I have or any line for that matter so I can go to 26 let's do that
now we're gonna do something different we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
create a data table that shows this and I'll show you that so in other words
we're going to do another header we're gonna call it let's just show show data

00:12
table hit enter and what we're gonna do is we're gonna enter another chunk now
does anybody remember what to do was a command alt I first try not bad on that
one okay it's a command alt I or ctrl shift I I'm not sure what the shortcut
is on a PC but you can also just manually type in three back ticks and
then the curly brace RR then remember the back tick is to the left of the
a quote how to quit single quote that'll definitely be troublesome if you get
those mixed up alright so we want to add a couple more libraries I'm gonna add
library called deep liar and another library called DT data table and you
probably don't have either one of those installed already so remember what you
have to do click on packages over here install and just type in DT you'll see
it populate automatically because it's in the cran library that's like an

00:13
official repository for these libraries so it's you can expect them to be safe
updated and relevant so DT click on install same thing once that's done do
deep plyer DPL why our install I've already got him installed so I can do
now I ran all the chunk the entire chunk with this play button before what you
could do is you could put your cursor on the end of the line or anywhere on the
line for that matter and you can either do ctrl enter or command enter if you
have a Mac so command enter it'll run that particular line only and then go
down to the next line and as you can see I've got a little bit of information
down here but it's not it didn't turn red it's these are warnings and those
warnings are really not relevant to this
tutorial so library DT let's do the same thing command enter sorry I ran them
separate that's fine I can run them over and over again it'll just overwrite I
can run the entire Chuck again so don't worry about that but do know that if

00:14
something that you rely on is above there and you make changes but you
didn't rerun it if it will affect and propagate down so you might want to
rerun the entire thing now that we have the library is loaded we can actually
use this so I'm gonna create another data frame it's called so basically
another spreadsheet if you if you will I'm gonna call it EDF and I'm going to
set it so this arrow says hey what have you do to the right-hand side save it to
this variable called the idea EDF and when it when I do run that
command the EDF will be over here in the
environment so I already have a variable
called data over here right this goes oh I forgot to mention that
so this line of code is called is the one that we downloaded
from the web we read the CSV file using this command here and it stored it into
a variable called data now we looked at the data just a minute ago it's right
here so I've got the name data because we controlled that by putting it in line
23 even though we copied and pasted it from the website just to catch you up on

00:15
that so I want to take the data that we just imported and I want to do stuff
with it I want to group it by country and territory control shift M will do
this pipe operator and on a PC it's probably the same thing but I'm not on
absentia 12:00 shift M will give this pipe operator and basically what you're
looking at and say hey take this data pipe it like you're gonna pipe a water
through a or pipe like a big vat of water through a pipe you're doing
something to it you're changing it maybe right so we want to pipe it to this
group by function so group by and we want a group of five countries and
territories so type that in and if you start typing it in far enough it'll give
you an option and once you find the the name of the variable you want you can
hit tab if you want it'll autocomplete and you know that it's correct and
spelled correctly that way so group by this I want to group it by that it's
almost like the English language now I'm

00:16
gonna do command shift Emma again before a pipe I want to pipe that into
something else I want to I want to create a variable now out of thin air so
there's no variable in there called death rate and I'm gonna add that in
there so I'm gonna use this function called mutate and the group by and
mutate are all coming from the deep liar package by the way so we're gonna do
mutate and I'm gonna create a variable what I want to call it death rate so I'm
gonna call it death rate and that's just my name and conventions you can call
whatever you want but now I'm gonna set it equal I'm gonna set it equal to a sum
of all the deaths oops of all the deaths divided by the
sum of all the cases and now I know that deaths and cases were part of that
original data set so I can use them and sum is just a function in our
you can sum all of that entire it's gonna sum the entire column except it's

00:17
gonna group it by because we have the group by here grouped by countries and
territories alright so once we have that we're gonna pipe that into no we're not
going to pipe that that's it that's all we want to do is add that one variable
so I'm gonna do command enter a command in turn on that make sure we get no
errors if you have an error see if you see if have a misspelling or something
we can look at ATF now you can see I have 11 variables here and if I click on
it you're gonna see a death rate on the right hand side right here and it's a
0.02 yeah you can multiply by 100 if you want make it a percent this tutorial is
just the bare bones so let's just go to another country to make sure that the
numbers change and they do Albania has a different percentage okay we can close
this now we have that we have the death rate next step I'm gonna move this down

00:18
here so we have a little bit more room and just for your FYI this is the our
notebook this is the console again this is the environment all right so we have
EDF now let's create a data a data table that displays this nicely for your
audience alright so in that case we're gonna use that DT library we're gonna
call it data table we're gonna call the function called data table so it's built
in and as you can see if I put the parenthesis there you see this little
yellow pop up it's probably pretty confusing if you don't know R but with
this part I would recommend maybe just copying exactly what I have and
modifying it using a couple of Google searches so inside of here I want to
bring in my data set so EDF and then I want to bring in something called
extinctions and I'm going to set that equal to buttons so that we can export
them and we can xsporter my CSV or PDF or Excel whatever
we want so then we'll do options equals a list I know this is like a little

00:19
complicated I'm gonna hit enter now notice the auto population of my right
parentheses that could confuse some people if you're not careful Dom equals
now don't be doing me wrong I don't memorize this either I'm using a
reference right now for this because once you set it and you make it the way
you want you usually just copy and paste it and change the set of data that goes
in comma buttons equals and now I'm going to describe the buttons I want I
want the copy button now these all have them that mean something and they do to
the data table function and the DT library so I'm a copy CSV Excel make
sure they're comma separated excl PDF and print that's what I have then I
should have two more parentheses at the end and that's that now white space
doesn't matter the parentheses will tell it when if you if you move the mouse to
the right of the last parenthesis you'll see the first parentheses in that in

00:20
that statement highlight so you can see where it says data table so that's how
you know okay they match we're good to go so we have a data table now so now
let's go ahead and play this entire chunk here and lucky for us it's all
green we don't know what's really doing yet but luckily this notebook file that
we have actually gives you a kind of a display of what its gonna look like it's
this so it's got these peg pagination or peg Nation whatever you want to call it
you can sort it by different things if you click on it and you'll notice to the
right there's probably more to the right but you can't see it from this view so
don't worry about that yet what I want to show you now is how to well let's
first save it so command S or file save when do command s first time saving you
have to name it so I'm going to name it you know intro intro to kovat whatever

00:21
you want to call it it doesn't matter click save now it's saved now we're
going to render this now there's two ways to render it the shortcut would be can
scroll shift K and if you want to go down here to the console which is down
here we can tell the console hey render this into an HTML file let's take a look
at it let's take a peek so let's do our markdown we're gonna say hey take this
our markdown this notebook file you have
there's our markdown language and render it into an HTML file for me thankfully
for the knitter package but you don't have to worry about that unless you
don't have the neuter package and we just called it Kovan if you start again
if you put it in parenthesis and you start typing in covent in hit tab you
can have a little drop down to help you out we want the RMD file the our
markdown file so intro to kovat in quotes dot RMD and then hit enter you'll
see it's going to churn and do some things and while it's doing that it's
creating the HTML file it says output created now if you don't have if if that

00:22
doesn't work there's a chance that you need to install a package called knitter
but if you download the latest version of our studio which should come with it
but okay and i TC k NT k nit r is what you might have to download I highly
doubt you'll have to do that because if you downloaded the latest version you
should be good to go click over your own files and let's go down to what what
just happened so what happened was intro to Kovac NB dot HTML was just created
the NB just stands for notebook right click on it and go to actually just left
click on it and go to open and web browser now you can open it in the
editor if you'd like but the editor has its own browser and it's not gonna be
the same as Chrome or ie so you want to view it in your own native browser so
that you know for a fact it works the way you want just to be extra careful
about it here's our output so we have all this code here you know that we
downloaded we have show table we have all this code and we have our death rate

00:23
we have our page nation or pag nation and you could see that as I move the
mouse it kind of highlights the row that I'm on and I can export copy do all
these different things so if I want to export the CSV or to PDF you just click
on CSV and you'll see down here for me it just downloaded it pretty awesome
pretty cool you can also hide the code if you'd like if you want
to present it without the code and you can actually have global options up here
we can actually download this R&amp;D file or hide or show all code etc etc so
that's your first taste finally let's scroll down just a tad bit
more on line 41 I'm gonna hit enter a couple times and you know when you do
that it usually disappears the stuff above or causes changes don't worry
about that all right so the last thing we want to
do is create a graph just to even things out with a little table and a graph and
then you're on your own so we have graph one we want to go down and create

00:24
another chunk so alt command I insert and we're gonna I'm gonna go ahead and
paste the code in there because it's a lot to kind of come up with without
references and you can just I'll walk you through it but you can change it
accordingly so what you'll notice is I have a library called the ggplot2 there
so you'll have to install that if you don't have it packages installed ggplot2
and just click on install you should be good to go so now what this chunk of
code is doing is I'm gonna walk you through it let's go ahead and hit play
first and so it creates a chart that we're gonna have and it takes the ADF
data frame the set of data that we've created with our death rates and all
that it's gonna pipe it with that pipe operator right here that's command shift
M you can get that as a shortcut or you can type in percent greater than percent
that's the pipe operator it's gonna take
say take that data pipe it into a filter
and once this filter gonna do it's gonna say hey only accept deaths that are

00:25
greater than 100 so it'll actually take this statement here this conditional
statement deaths greater than 100 and say only one that's true keep the data
so it's actually going to filter the EDF data down for us once it filters it's
gonna pipe that output into a new input that input is going to be the group by
the group by is I want to group everything by countries and territories
so every angle that you look at this data will be viewed in that perspective
as countries and territories group two there now we're gonna pipe that so he's
continuously piping things into more functions into a summarized function
because I'm curious to know how many deaths they actually have total per
country because don't forget it's grouped by the countries and territories
so after you group it tell me the summary of what's inside of this
function here which is I created a variable called death total came out of

00:26
thin air does not exist yet until I run this statement I'm gonna set it equal to
the sum so I'm gonna add up all of the deaths and I remember deaths is part of
the table we have a deaths column so add
up all the deaths but not all the deaths all the deaths per country that are
greater than 100 and then we pipe that into a GG plot that's the actual plot
and mechanism that we're gonna use and you don't have to know too much about it
but we need an aesthetic to map to the plot because the GG plot is like a blank
canvas and then the AES is aesthetic when I say hey let the x-axis equal the
countries and territories I want that but again don't forget we're only doing
the deaths out of the gray that are greater than 100 and then we're gonna
add to that so that notice the plus and not the pipe so with GG plot anything
with a GG plot and you want to add layers to it you would add it with the
addition symbol when added geometric points so the actual points that you see
on the plot is what we're adding and what are the points well the Y we're
gonna call the deaths total that we just

00:27
created up here or we're about to create
when we hit them the go button right and then I flipped the coordinate axes
because otherwise you would have the countries along the x-axis and they
would kind of blend together overlap and it's just not going to be aesthetically
pleasing so that's what that is before we go any further though I want to show
you a tab set so we can add a little functionality to this we have graph one
let's do a doubleheader graph two and so
I'm sorry we'll call it graph a so graph 1 graph a or we can just call it a it
doesn't matter so this is a and we're gonna copy all of this and I'm gonna go
ahead and come and see it come down to line 58 command V
we'll call this graph B and we don't need to load the library more than once
so we can delete this now we have the same code here but instead of death

00:28
total let's do cases total so I'm just gonna replace this with cases total and
I'm gonna make that the sum of the cases and then I'm also gonna plot the cases
total so it'll be somewhat similar and the filter let's see what it looks like
the filter yeah because it's still gonna be the deaths that's only a filter but
notice the numbers on the x-axis you have somewhere on one two three 200,000
somewhere at 200,000 deaths for the United States of America at this time so
that sounds about right actually so I think everything is good you'd have to
obviously double check all that now let's go ahead and save this command S
and rerun the chunk and I'll show you a couple more things we'll call it quits
so our markdown render and this is called intro to Cove it RMD let that run
okay so click on the intro to kovat and b dot HTML opening web browser or view
and web browser you'll see it's the same

00:29
thing we had we have the data table here we have graph 1 then notice graph a is
slightly smaller than we have graph B so they've got different headers right but
we can do better than that let's go back to our code and I want to show you what
tab set does so if we do go all the way to graph 1 and then hit a space and do a
curly brace open which is right there and do dot tab set and then close the
curly brace if it did not automatically do that for you what that does is it'll
make tabs into anything that has a higher header by one level so this
number two hash tag is one level higher and so isn't this one so they're both
being their own tabs command S save that again and let's go down here click the
up arrow and you'll get the latest command that you ran and enter again
let's run that one more time and I'll show you the difference
all right so let's reopen this up view in web browser and as you scroll down

00:30
you will see here's our first graph on graph a tab and then graph B so there's
two different tabs two different axes now you have both so you can show this
off it's not elaborate but it's a good start I think this will get you started
with maybe your love for our and statistics and our predictive analysis
so what your homework is gonna be of course is to you know Google a little
bit about ggplot and create some different plots maybe do that mute tape
function that we have up here where we're creating new variables right here
so it's mutate I'm creating a death rate maybe come up with your own rates for
example we have populations so maybe you
can do something with density so you can do a mutate what you do is you would do
control shift M pipe that into a nether mutate add the variable name equals and
what do you want it to be you could do other functions besides some I'm not
going to show you how to do that because that's some of the research you have to

00:31
do however that being said I think this is a good start so have fun with it and
leave me some comments and whatnot and I will see you guys in the next oneEnd of file
