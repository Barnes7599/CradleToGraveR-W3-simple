today I'm gonna show you how to create some cool dashboards to show off your
your work that you've done so far so this is a blank sort of dashboard that I
just created quickly we're gonna make this actually a little bit more
extensive but you can see I have different areas we have chart a B and C
we have a little About section here and I have multiple pages and I have a title
here called untitled we're gonna fix all that as we go but I want to show you
this is the basic layout we're gonna throw some graphs in here we're gonna
put some data in there to be able to download and I'm going to show you the
process on how to do that with the simple tool called Flex dashboard so
that being said let's go back to our our create a fresh new project file new
project you don't have to create a new project I just want to start from
scratch for anybody that's jumping in right now so we want to create it in a
new directory most likely and a new project here we're gonna call this our
Flex dashboard project whatever you want

00:01
to call it but we're gonna create new so that we can all start off on the same
page and I'm gonna go fairly quickly because I want to get right to it I
think once you see the results you're gonna be amazed and say you know what I
can use this I don't need Excel anymore you know things like that so we have our
project now what you want to do is probably first of all install a couple
of things here so let's go to packages install and type in Flex dashboard Flex
dashboard and you see it pops up it's in the cran library install that I already
have it installed but I'll click the button again and you get a couple
warnings no big deal another thing that download is probably this thing called
DT data table if you don't already have that install that that's going to allow
us to create some tables that have some functionality like filtering and
searching capabilities like that any more than that I will walk you through
as we as we need them so okay we have our our project open let's go to file

00:02
new file and if you didn't download Flex dashboard or install it like I just did
you're not going to have this option so when you go to file new go to our
markdown so it seems like a normal markdown until you get down to this from
template menu click that and you'll see I have an option
here called flex dashboard we're gonna use that one so click on Flex dashboard
and hit OK and again if you don't have that there make sure you did the
packages install Flex dashboard all right so we come up here and we have a
template layout now I showed you this this file right here let's close I'm
gonna close this one and I'm going to show you how this one works it's already
prefilled out with some examples so before we can actually use this we have
to save it so let's just do a quick save file save there we go
file save and we'll just call this our I
don't know report dashboard what are you gonna call it report dashboard it's
under my Flex dashboard project directory so it's there cool we saved it

00:03
now let's run this thing and by run it I
mean let's render this into an HTML file so we can use it like a dashboard so
right out-of-the-box without doing any coding we're gonna go down here to the
console we're gonna type in our markdown
colon colon render and then we'll put in our Flex if I hit the tab button it'll
auto populate I don't want that no no no this is called report dashboard I'm
sorry getting all mixed up here so in quotes report dashboard r dot R MD so
we're gonna run that just like this so our markdown colon colon render report
dashboard and it says output created cool that was simple let's click on our
files over here and then we're gonna click on report dashboard HTML you
should have an HTML file now because we just rendered we knitted this into an
HTML so we're gonna click on View in web browser and I'll pull that over so you

00:04
can see it I have it multiple screens so this is what we just created with
without doing anything this is out of the box so we have our layout here chart
a chart be chart see we have an untitled
here let's leave this open if you'd like
you don't have to close it let's go back to our our markdown and I'll show you a
couple things that we can tweak right off the bat
for example this title untitled let's call that our
our TPS report so then I'm gonna hit save a lot command s just to make sure I
capture everything and let's scroll down a little bit and just kind of see and
dissect what we're seeing here on line 13 we have column and it says data width
equals 650 what can you imagine that is well it's a column here and it looks
like 650 out of a thousand pixels or whatever unit of measure it is but it's
basically two-thirds of the page is sharda and then chart B and C are on the
right hand side so let's just keep that in mind as we go down here so 650 for

00:05
that column and you see I have these 3 hashtags in chart a so it's third
indentation or a third header called chart a we saw a was on the left hand
side and now we go down and it says column and it says data with 350 350 +
650 is a thousand so basically break up your screen into units where a thousand
covers the whole horizontal span and that's what you get now you see here
that column underneath the right-hand column which is the smaller one - 350 I
have to chart B and chart C both with three hash tags right so the fact that I
have another column so from column to column that's one whole column and then
this column to the end is the other column but you notice that there's two
charts in this column column or chart B and chart C right so that's just how it
works now we can fiddle with these numbers you can make these numbers split
evenly you could do 500 and 500 and let's save that and render this again

00:06
remember to render you can type in all that or just hit the up arrow and you'll
get to your last command that you ran so hit that let's go back over here and
refresh it and what do we have we have a
split split and you can add more columns
if you'd like it doesn't have to be that
we could do 500 let's do 250 on this one and then let's go ahead and copy this
lines 22 and 23 and we'll go ahead and paste it down here and we now have
another column with nothing there let's go ahead and copy the chart stuff just
so we can have something to look at and I pasted in there I'm gonna call
that chart D and now let's see what we have control s come back down here hit
the up arrow and run it again let's go back and refresh you see I added a
nother chart D that spans the entire vertical distance pretty cool and by the
way our TPS report is now called TPS report and not untitled so that's pretty

00:07
nice too I'm going to show you a couple more things now that we're here this is
just a layout situation for now so now I
want to show you how to add another page
so there's a couple things here that I'd
like to show you instead of these dashes which you have to have the right amount
of dashes and it has to say column here and then you'll create a column but you
can also do it a different way instead of calling it column I can I can just do
two hash tags and call it column and delete this I just want to show you that
they're both work if I hit command S on that we run it and this is important
because I kind of don't like the dashes because you really have to keep track of
how many dashes you have so there we go so nothing changed and that's exactly
what I wanted to show you so instead of the dashes you can do the two hash tags
and then put the column in there and then the data width oh there's also so
this orientation up here at the very top
where it says columns you can also do it in a row layout so we're dealing with

00:08
columns that are going left and right and right and left and the rows it would
you'd be dictating the height of each row and every time you split a row up
it'll split it into columns so instead our columns are being split into rows
it's we we can play around that I'll show you where to find different layouts
to in just a moment but I wanted to show you that we can do that but there's one
other thing we can do we can also do pages so let's take a quick look at it
one more time you see how we have TPS report and we have all these charts
let's add a whole nother page as if it's a whole nother section here so to do
that let's first start with a page right here and what we're going to do just as
you would probably guess is one hash tag and we're going to call it page one or
we'll call it a start page we'll call the start page I'm going to hit command
S on that and let's go down to the very bottom and let's go ahead and create
another page so you really get a feel for that's doing we're gonna do expert
whatever you wanna call it expert page and then we can do a column if you say

00:09
column and we can set the data width and all that by doing the curly braces data
width equals 500 and let's just run with this and say test right there command s
let's go run it I got this microphone in my way so I have to keep looking around
it alright output is created let's go back and hit the refresh button boom
alright so this page still looks the same but as you see up here I have a
start page and an expert page and on the expert page I have nothing on there
except for a test now because there's only one column it spans the whole thing
what we have to do is add another column
if we wanted to actually see it let's do let's do it this way and then we'll do
another test to command desk and of course you're gonna have to play around
these quite a bit because not everything is gonna be as intuitive as you think
and you're gonna mess up a little bit well okay so it did work

00:10
I have test on the left hand side and test on the right hand side and we'll
expand more on that in just a few but mostly what I want to do is I want to
populate these now with certain things so this was the beginning intro level of
how to create a Flex dashboardEnd of file
