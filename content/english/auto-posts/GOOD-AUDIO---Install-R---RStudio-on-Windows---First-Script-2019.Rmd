we are gonna download our and our studio and install them both on this fresh
clean virtual machine Microsoft Windows so I have Microsoft edge down here we're
gonna open that up and instead of typing
in the URL we'll just go ahead and go to
google.com or whatever search engine you want to use and just type in download
our and the first site should be the our project our - project org click on that
and then this site hasn't changed in years for the most part so the top part
looks very similar and it has a download link here to download our so click on
download our go down to a mirror site that's close to your location I'm in the
USA so I'm going to click on that and finally you have a prompt to pick your
platform of choice Linux Mac or Windows I'm gonna go ahead and download this for
Windows I'm running the windows on top of my macbook in a virtual machine once

00:01
you click on that you get to this page then it tells you to install our for the
first time click here and you finally get to the download link right here
download our three point six point one at the time and the latest stable
release should be this one here that it that it gives you by default there are
developer versions as well you can download if you're interested so I
clicked on that and with this I'm just going to go ahead and save it as and
I'll put it on the desktop so that we can find it easy now that's downloading
I can close well instead of closing this let's go ahead and download our studio
while we're at it we're not going to install it yet though so again just go
to google.com and type in download our studio very simple and it's the our
studio comm I like to use Google because sometimes when I tell people to go to
our studio they might misspell it or something like that but you can go
directly to the link if you want most likely you're going to want this free

00:02
version the art studio desktop and so when you click on download here it'll
bring you down to installers for supported platforms as you can see it
says Windows Mac and Ubuntu Linux I'm again using a Windows machine in a
VirtualBox and it is the very top one we're gonna go ahead and download that
while that's downloading well let's just go ahead and save it actually I'll save
it as and we'll put this on the desktop as well and you really want to install
our first because our studio relies on our being installed so here's my our
version three point six point one on the desktop let's go ahead and install that
while our studio is finishing up the download of course I'm going to click
yes I want to install this app pick your language and run through the steps read

00:03
all the pages of fun and pick your location and you you probably want to
install the 32-bit and the 64-bit file because there's certain applications
that might be 32-bit versus 64-bit and there are occasions where you want to
swap out which version you want to use we're not going to get into that here
but a lot of for example government applications are still using 32-bit
versions of Microsoft Access and sometimes with are you want to access
the access in order to do that you need the 32-bit version I don't want to
customize and here we go we're just going to go through the menu system like
any any other installation I'm sure that you're all familiar with that we're
gonna load this up we're not even gonna test this out honestly once it's done
installing we're just going to go ahead and and install the our studio and our
studio is going to point to this version of our as its back-end to actually run
the scripts you can also download previous versions of our for example if
your work only has like a two point X type version you can download that as

00:04
well as a 3.5 and within our studio you can actually set up which are to use
which version so you can do it that way ok our is all set up and now we're just
going to set up our studio here's the other link for that and again it's a
similar guide usually the default locations is what I use once in a while
you might want to change that to say next
hard drive or an SSD drive to save space on your your local machine but I think
for the most part using the defaults is all I'm going to do and we're going to
run this and what I'll do when this is done is I will open it up and I will
show you a couple quick settings and then we'll run our first script just to
show you that it works so let's go ahead and click on the Start menu and we're
going to type in RS for our studio and you can see it pops right up here I'm
also gonna right click on it and I'm going to pin it to my taskbar because
that's where I like to put things that I use a lot so now it's down here I'm

00:05
going to click on R now that's not R as in the R version three point six this is
our studio and it just happens to have the R as the icon so here we go we have
a our studio setup and let me just explain this is the console this area
here is your environment where when you store variables it'll show up there and
down here is kind of like a nice little viewer for files for plots to install
packages you can do all that down in this area and of course everything is
customizable with size this right here is the console so we can do something
like print and just type in hello world here hit enter and as you can see on
output line number one it says hello world this is not an R script this is
just the our console let's go to your tools and go to global options and I'll
show you just a couple quick things remember I said you can have different
versions of our well here's where you would change that if you download it our
version 2 point ax or a different version for whatever reason it would be

00:06
changed right here finally we are going to go to appearance because I like to
set this as a different size font especially when I'm tutoring online so
I'm going to set that up to be a little bit bigger and then also you can pick a
a color theme basically so whatever you choose Eclipse or whatever let's just do
a dark theme here hit apply or hit OK and it says do you want to restart yes
it's really really quick usually now this is pretty good because it's running
in a virtual machine on top of my macbook that's a 2017 MacBook
so now I have my new colors let's start a new project file new project this way
we can contain all of our stuff in one directory I'm going to put it in a new
directory and we're going to do new project we're gonna keep it simple
simple simple direct your name I'm going to call it first our project make it
nice and simple now I'm going to click browse just to see where the default
location is so it looks like the default

00:07
is under your documents that's perfectly fine for me I'm going to keep that and
I'm just going to click on create project and you'll see only a slight
change your files over here are now under that project you see it's under
home first project right here you can see the directory structure let's go
ahead and do a new script now this is your first our script file new or file a
new file our script there's a lot of options and in other tutorials or
further down the line with this tutorial
I'll show you and explain a lot of these
other features let's click on our script this is our very first script and we're
going to do the same thing we can say print in parenthesis hello world and the
world never replies back so that's really awkward now there's two ways to
run this code you can either hit if you're on a Macbook command enter and if
you're on Windows I believe it's ctrl enter control enter here and you can see

00:08
down here on output line number one hello world so you know it works
everything is fine and that's it now you can save this file let's go ahead and
click on save ctrl s and I'm going to call it for a script and that's going to
automatically default to the project directory which is right here for a
script first our project it's all accessible through here which is nice
and then if you had plots they would be here packages we'll get into packages a
little bit later but to update packages or to install them you can click on
install it makes it very very simple and
for your global environment that's again if you have things in your RAM or your
environment for example this variable var variable a I'm going to assign that
number and then I'm gonna do control-enter and you'll see it shows up
on my right-hand side because it's stored in memory it's using an actual
space and here it is to clean that up you can actually delete the variables by

00:09
clicking on this broom and clicking yes and then you can start all over that's
one way to do it click on run it'll run the entire thing
and I thought there was a way to run the whole thing but I guess I guess
highlighting it and hit and run is it's just good enough for now well that's it
I wanted to keep this short and simple for a Windows or a Mac user to download
and install our if you have any questions put them in the comments or
comment below or send me a message if you have any tips or tricks go ahead and
put those down there as well I'd love to hear from you so stay tuned there's
plenty of more exercises and tutorials to goEnd of file
