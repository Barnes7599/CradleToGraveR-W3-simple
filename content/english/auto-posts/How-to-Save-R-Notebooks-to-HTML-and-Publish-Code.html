okay we are back I’m going to continue on where we left off it looks like we
had a plot of the cars cars data set that comes included so if I hit a little
play button on the on the right hand side here you’ll see that our cars will
be plotted down here because it says plot the cars enough about this let’s
talk about saving our file now this is an RMD file and our markdown or a
notebook file so we want to actually see what this is going to look like if we
were to publish it to say a website up here you’re gonna see where it says
preview we can click on the preview button and it’s going to ask us to save
it first let’s save this as test one and we’re just gonna pick a spot for it I
have it in my directory called testin which is my project directory it’s
important to know that everything in your project directory is relatively
easy to access within your environment so save that as test one and it’s</p>
<p>00:01
rendering now it’s going to create a preview for me I believe you will see
down here I have test 1 not NBI HTML so if I go to my Finder window and I go to
my tests in the area you will see that I also have test 1 dot Rd we just saved
that file test-1 NB HTML don’t worry about that dot NB that just stands for
dot notebook and we have our project file we can open up this HTML file
which I’ll do here so this is an HTML file that’s on my my desktop or on my
hard drive and as you see it has a title our notebook
and it has some text but then it has this grey area that’s our actual R code
and if I click on hide here you can actually hide the code and up here on
the very top right we have a global hide show all code or hide all code or you
can download this RMD file Wow that’s pretty awesome if I download this RMD
file I can send it to my friends and literally they can hit the Run button</p>
<p>00:02
and it’ll run exactly the same way so that’s called repeat reproducibility and
that’s very important within data science and any programming in general
so as you can see it’s kind of laid out there’s nothing fancy here but let’s go
back let’s close this out and we’re going to go back to our studio
and I’m gonna show you how to do a couple things in here let’s highlight
line six through nine and just delete it and we’re gonna type in our own text
this is exploratory analysis using our and our markdown language okay now we
saw the title was our notebook let’s change that title and like like let’s
just put it as our test whatever we want to do it and we have output as HTML
notebook but that’s not extremely important at this point so what we want
to do is we want to let’s go ahead and change lines 13 through 17 as well and</p>
<p>00:03
just say something like this is the end and then if we hit preview on that this
is an actual preview as you can see it says this is the end this is in our test
work everything worked this is not an HTML file so to speak right now this is
within our studio it’s saying hey if this was an HTML file this is what it
would look like so to generate the file itself there’s a couple different ways
you can click on this little down arrow here and you can type in NIT to HTML and
if you click on that it will actually render and knit it and it’s going to
populate our HTML file so if we go back to our file which is also will be here
on the bottom right which I described as our filing cabinets if I go to tests 1
dot HTML notice now how its test 1 by HTML and not test one notebook dot HTML
slight difference so if I click on that and I go to open in browser view in web</p>
<p>00:04
browser it’ll again populate and it’s gonna look just like this okay so as you
can see here there’s no code because we rendered it in as HTML file so notice
the slight differences now if I want to knit it to PDF you can do that or word
so instead of doing all the knit in I can what I can do is I can run this
entire file by clicking on this run here and do run all which is down at the
bottom and when I do that that’ll date my notebook file so there’s a
notebook HTML file and there’s a test one at HTML with it which has no code so
let’s go ahead and open up our notebook which is right here view and web browser
and I’ll drag that over for us here we go so see the difference between
notebook and regular HTML now those parameters you can set to make all of
these things kind of interchangeable like I can add code to the HTML if I
wanted to I can make it so the code doesn’t show up automatically there’s
all kinds of parameters we’ll get into well I just wanted to show you how to do</p>
<p>00:05
this so again you have show all code and you have hide all code so no matter
where you have you can have this as a presentable published document for your
supervision or for your team whatever you want to do okay so that’s it now
there’s a couple quick things I want to add to our markdown remember that our
markdown is anywhere that’s not between these back ticks or at the very top
metadata portion so let’s add exploratory and make that into a bold so
highlight the whole thing and is a little quick shortcut you can hit the
shift 8 which is star and you see that the star actually showed up on both
sides just a little quick thing that’s actually italic if I want a bold I have
to do it again so let’s do it again now double that will end up being bold you
can’t see it here but this is our markdown let’s say we wanted to a list
so we want to double double space down and we want to put one star two spaces
this is important this this is actually very subtle but very important and we</p>
<p>00:06
say this is item one star two spaces this is item two and then to end this
we’re going to do two spaces and say this is the end of the list okay cool
let’s run that and what this star space space and don’t forget the space below
and above the stars will give us a generated list let’s take a look at it
and now this is a regular HTML file you can take this you can publish it to your
WordPress you can publish it to your website anything you want to do with it
okay so we have let’s see did not work there let’s see what we did
wrong I did run all NIT let’s see what it looks like in HTML first real quick
so it did happen in our HTML I’m not sure why oh because you have to save it</p>
<p>00:07
I’m sorry in order to have it render in your notebook you have to save it then
it should be in your notebook yeah there’s all kinds of little things that
you’re gonna run into so don’t sweat it it happens to everybody learn stack
overflow so here it is here’s our actual notebook file once you save it the
notebook will be updated when you run it
where you run it then save it one of the other okay so it’s in both of our HTML
and our NB HTML file that’s it for today I’m going to go to the 4th of July
celebrations so I will put this up and hopefully add another one for Monday I
hope you find these videos to be a value to you and if you do check out some of
the links in the descriptions especially want to give a shout out to tubebuddy
