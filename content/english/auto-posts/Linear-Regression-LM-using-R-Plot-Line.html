welcome back today we’re gonna take what
we did on paper create those linear fit lines based on some data points and the
best fit right so it’s gonna be a very simple simple tutorial less than five
minutes I promise less than five minutes this time so let’s just jump right into
it we’ll start by creating a data frame and go from there so we want to create a
data frame I’ll just call it example data IX data and we will assign that
into a data frame don’t forget right so we want to create a data frame and we’ll
create predictor and response variables we can call it we call it anything we
want let’s do weight and height so let’s say we have a weight variable right
we’re going to set that equal to a column of numbers a vector or
spreadsheet looking column right so when the weight is say 100 pounds does
another person that weighs 160 pounds and another person that weighs 220 right</p>
<p>00:01
so let’s start off simple with just three three values so that we don’t get
too confused so then I’m going to create
the heights based on that and we’ll just
I don’t know how to convert to inches or
centimeters but figure hundred pounds is probably you know 45 inches we’ll call
it 160 pounds maybe that’s a 69 inches and in 220 pounds this is purely made-up
maybe that’s a 74 inches somebody a little bit taller right so that’s our
data so let’s go let’s just start off by running that make sure it works and we
are good to go let me zoom back out for you you can see in my global environment
that I’ve created the data frame we can actually go into this data frame and see
exactly what I just typed in we just created that from thin air we have we
want to plot that with our GG plot to load that in if you don’t have it</p>
<p>00:02
packages installed ggplot2 simple as that you should know that by now
so let’s just go ahead and create the plot without the line so the first thing
we’ll do is we’ll just say hey I want a new plot I’m gonna have my data is going
to be my example data and my aesthetic I need to map some
sort of values to this plot so the X is going to be equal to our weight so we’re
gonna say hey based on the weight based on the weight what are the heights so
that the Y value is height okay now that’s not it so we just have our canvas
or a blank canvas we need to know hey what kind of plot do you want well I
want a point plot G on Point G on underscore the point and we run that let
me get me out of the way here you can see the plot now and you see those three
points they’re relatively you know they’re almost lined up but you know you
can’t fit a line through all those you know so let’s let’s go ahead and add</p>
<p>00:03
another geometry to this and I’ll show you how to do that so let’s go back to
[Music] the code and you can see that I’m just
gonna add to this I’m gonna say G on smooth now you guys might like this it’s
kind of fun if I literally just kommandantur on this you’ll see once I
get out of the way and zoom out there we go it fit a actual more complex line
that’s not a linear line we don’t want to start with that we don’t want to
start with that so let’s go ahead and change that geometry smooth into a
linear model like we were discussing before so then we can say method equals
LM for a linear model and then rerun this code right you ready I’m gonna
rerun this code and you have a model with some confidence intervals things</p>
<p>00:04
like that you could see that the line doesn’t quite fit any of the points to
make the best fit line but it used simple linear regression to create that
line now you don’t know what that lines equation is at this point you don’t know
much about it but you know now that you can ply a line through any set of data
points that you’d like so in the next lesson we’ll get into some more of the
specifics and how to customize this just a little bit better
simple as that less than five minutes share like and subscribe etc [Music]End of file</p>
