looks like we are live now so welcome um everybody who
shows up here i appreciate your support i want to first give everybody a few
minutes to log in so i'll just kind of talk briefly about what's the motivation
behind this and what the expectations are that you can get within the next uh
probably 45 minutes to an hour is my guess we'll see if things break or
not on the on the way to making this site go live so
i do expect if you're trying to follow along i will be going
pretty fast because i'm also going to record this in fact
i didn't hit record yet let me try that there we go so i'm recording now
and i'm on i'm on live on youtube so i expect you to have at least r installed
already and then rstudio which i think most people

00:01
that are in this chat will because i've posted only a couple places where
it's r related but uh so yeah i have r and r studio already installed
and then finally we're going to install a couple of things
i actually uninstalled a few things so i can actually walk through that process
to kind of make it as real as possible i do think that because everyone's going
to have different speeds of their computers and different speeds
of just navigating to where they're supposed to go
i'm gonna be ahead of you probably on most of this so
you can try to follow along but i probably will skip some steps like i've
already got a github account so i don't have to sign up you
you might have to i already have a netlafey account etc etc so we'll get
into that here in just a few minutes i want to give um just another moment or
two before we begin just so that if anybody really wanted to
be here for the live session they can be here so we'll give it

00:02
another two or three minutes and we'll go from there but oh what i have here
is the book that that i believe would pronounce a ye hoy ji
he created this book called creating websites with our markdown and that was
the motivation for the video tutorials that some of you
have already seen that i did so i skimmed through it fast because
i've done this a couple years ago like in 2016
late 2016 maybe things have changed of course but
and it's been a while so i zoomed through this book pretty fast and that's
where the motivation came from so i wanted to give credit where
credit's due and that's right here and i would definitely here let me see
if i can give you the url for this a little bit bigger
there we go fact i'm just getting set up here to make sure that
the stream goes as smooth as possible and if you have any questions i'll try
to answer them i don't know how often i'll be looking back at the actual
uh chat but i'll try if i get if my attention goes that way

00:03
i'll try to answer them i you know the scope of this is going to be creating a
r project that's going to have the block down
package installed with hugo as a theme and we're going to push that to github
and we are going to have netlify pull from github as github changes and
actually hosts the site live where anybody can go to it
the only caveat is you know you don't have your own domain name
like cradle to graver.com so we'll have to use a netlify
uh you know domain like it'll be my project dot net le fee
something right all right so we have uh a couple people here now i think we will
get started here in just a few more moments
i want to make sure that uh if somebody truly did want to try to follow along as
best they could they can do it live but again all of these live videos will be
they'll stay on youtube i'm not going to delete them but what i will probably do
is condense them and create an edited version

00:04
that you can always reflect back on but this this should be a really
easy process it took a couple of tries for me because
you know the first time for anything is always the hardest so i'm hoping that
this live video goes smooth um the first time around but if i run into trouble
maybe you guys can help me out with the chat maybe we give up i don't know but i
don't think we'll have any trouble so that being said how about we start in
about one minute when it's 3 50. and i'll try to walk you through end to end and
again uh have r and r studio already installed if you want to try to keep
up again i don't think you'll keep up completely but maybe you can get a good
start on it and refer back to the video and the book the book that's showing
up in your screen right now is a really easy
book to read now the videos that i put together
might go through a little bit more detail you know all these little nuances
that happen along the way it'll drive you nuts some of the some of
the problems i had took me like two hours to fix and it was

00:05
just like the stupidest thing right so hopefully i can walk you through all
that and you don't have to worry about it
i've only done this once recently doing those tutorials
and now i think in my head oh i can do this end-to-end and show everybody live
we'll see i'm a little nervous but we'll get through it worst case scenario
is it doesn't work and we try it again but all right it's 3 50. so i am going
to get started i will probably check back on the chat here and there if
you guys have questions or compliments or any criticisms whatever you have go
ahead and let me know so that being said again let's start this thing
i'll show you my intro my this is what i love showing is my intro here it is
maybe yeah so that's my uh that's my original
there we go that's my original intro for my mark gingras.com site that's

00:06
basically the r site now i use obs online broadcast system to [Music]
record all of my videos and so in that other channel i actually teach how to
use obs to do stuff like this all right here we go blog down so we started this
with blog down book by uh ye hoy ji and it's a really excellent
book it's a quick read you can follow this and probably get to the same point
um so that's where i began so let's begin our journey with our
our rstudio so everybody should have our
studio we're going to create a brand new project
actually excuse me we're going to start with github
let's start with github because we're going to skip a lot of the fluff and
just get right to it so go to github.com and uh right for me it would be
i think already up i've got so many sites up here we go so github.com and

00:07
i will show my url a little bit bigger there so github.com
if you haven't signed up it's real simple you would just put in a username
email and password um and sign up you'll probably be able to sign up with
like linkedin or something else maybe and it'll be a quick process but note
that this username will probably be like your resume so try to not make it
ridiculous sound in or hard to get to if you're actually trying to get a data
science job or a programming job or anything and
they can't get to your github account because it's
a weird spelling or it's got too many weird stuff in there
not good so just try to make it as professional as possible now of course
i've already got a github account so i'm going to sign right in
i've got my username take note of your username and the email address you use
for this process because you'll need it again later alright i signed in and you
should get a sort of something like this that pops up
you know might be a slightly different home screen it could be

00:08
yeah so this is my home screen apparently but what you notice i'm practicing my
zoom in with obs too what you notice is that up
here on the left hand side i have this new button so new repository
i want to be able to place all of my code from r and r studio
to this repository and so git is a version control
uh website where you can push and pull soft uh code back and forth and as you do
that it keeps track of every version you can have collaborations you can
branch off of your code to create a whole new project
it's really fantastic so click on new and we're going to create a project
there we go notice my owner is called mt gen grass that's the name that i used
for my github it's uh my github username i'm gonna call this cradle to
grave r everybody should probably kinda know what that means now end to end
process i like the end to end so cradle to grave show me everything

00:09
all right there we go we have my username and my repository name now
that's important but i'll show you why in a second all
right so the free version you have to have public so if you have errors or
mistakes and you don't want them to be shown or you want to practice something
you know it's it's all public if you do private you have to pay for that service
which by all means go for it if you want to initialize this repository with the
readme if if you ever see anybody's github account they all have a readme and it
kind of describes all right here's how you can possibly
you know clone my not clone not really how to clone it but what is my project
all about right so i'm going to create that repository very simply
by clicking that button and now now you see i'm at a new site here and
over to the right i have this clone or download button
we're going to click on clone or download and there's a url
here that's been created i'm just going to copy that
and once you copy that let's go to our studio
which i don't have open yet oh yeah i do right here

00:10
so don't worry about any of this we're going to do file new project
instead of doing new directory like we would normally do in most of our
projects we're going to go to version control
ah excuse me i'm skipping a step already before we do that
before we do that we have to download git so let's go back here i have this site
for people with windows called get for windows get for windows.org
you want to go to that site or if you have a mac i don't
i haven't done this process with a mac but i'm sure it's very similar
the website is git dash scm.com download you should be able to find it
it's just get there's various ways to install things
in mac that are through like the homebrew or brew
or versus other means you know just downloading the
installers and whatnot the dmg files whatever they are
i hope that you can follow along with the get for mac it'll be a similar

00:11
process but probably slightly different all right so i have to do this because i
actually uninstalled this so let's do this and i wanted to do that
just to show you more of the process so i have a fast machines
and fast internet so here we go i will see if i can zoom in on this a little bit
all right so here's the gnu general public license agreement
um you should probably familiarize familiarize yourself with some of those
because uh if you're dealing with software and
programming though that agreement is pretty common
all right so i'm just going to install it in the installation directory that
they recommend uh it already exists would you like to
install that folder anyways sure so i guess when i installed it it
probably kept my settings you know how that works
i'm not going to worry about it too much i'm just going to overwrite it
now these are all defaulted i'm not going to change any of those
and i am going to continue with this default setting

00:12
and now here this would be the default editor used by git i'm not going to
worry about that because we're going to be using rstudio
and they're going to do most of the work for us all right now this is probably
the most important setting that you want to make sure you
select the correct option get from the command line
and also from third-party software now third-party software i mean
in our studio is going to do some of the work for us using git as the back end
that's exactly what you want okay so that's the most important takeaway
from downloading git i actually have to install it um i'm
going to continue using the defaults continue continue there's a lot of
options here a lot of chances to mess up that's for sure
but as you can see i have actually used the default for absolutely everything
and i just wanted you to focus on that one option that um that was crucial
but of course that even that option was defaulted for me so good to go

00:13
all right so i'm not gonna view the readme notes i just wanted to install it
and it doesn't ask me to restart my computer or anything so hopefully you
guys are in the same boat and you're fine so git has been installed now i have
my r studio already open right that might be a problem so let's close
it out completely and reopen it because we installed git
we want our studio to recognize that it's been installed and it will
automatically do some connections for us so close that out completely uh maybe
if i clicked it yeah and let's see let's
see how many people we have we have four concurrent users
hey i'm building up a little community here i love it
it is fun uh this is becoming more fun as you guys get more involved by the way
i and the trick is to not bs anybody with anything if i don't know
something i don't know it i'm not a statistician right
i like to use practical r like r to make my life easier you know
that's what i use it for currently and so hopefully i'm gonna make your life

00:14
easier by building this site all right so we've restarted it
you could see already that lost myself okay so i'm in the way i'm
going to jump out of the way here and under uh this tab here i have git
you might not have that because you might not have a project open but i
wanted to show you that that's what we're going to be looking for is that get
and then also under um build no not build no that's it for now
so we we're going to do file new project and i don't care about
the changes normally again we would go to new directory and keep our stuff
clean and tidy in a nice little spot this time we're going to go to version
control version control and now we have git here
if you didn't install git you probably still have this option but when you
click on it you won't get to this screen here and this is where it's important
to those are my shortcut keys that i can't help but use right so we want to do

00:15
a control v or a command v on this and that'll be your url that you were just at
for the github page right here what you cloned
i know you can't see the whole thing but that's what we're looking at
now you notice that the project directory name automatically filled in
it's either because it grabbed it from most likely it's because it's just part
of the name and they know that the cradle to grave r
dot get is the name to use but it might have actually checked the website you
know i have no idea probably not because we didn't connect
it yet anyways create project i'm going over to tangent
oh it already exists well excuse me yours probably doesn't exist
so let me delete that project first real quick so i've done this
in the past and i have it i'm just going to go ahead and quickly delete that
folder in fact i'm going to close out my r again
i probably didn't need to do that but all right so what did i say under

00:16
site test cradle to graybar delete gone all right i'm back
i'm back let's do this again well this is one way you can catch up is
if i keep making mistakes if i keep making mistakes you can catch
up maybe unless you make the same mistakes all right new project version control
git control v cradle to grave r site test i could have easily just put it into a
different directory but i didn't anyways create project now it's
going to be an empty project with that readme file because we started this
process remember on github before we did any code in anything
we literally went to github created a repository we know we're going to store
this it's nice because you'll be able to you
know go to work go somewhere else go down the street and just pull that same
repository and you'd be in the same exact place as long as you continue to
use git as your your place to uh hold your code and version control it
all right that's it i've got nothing here uh it's an empty project
there's nothing there but you should have this get um tab

00:17
you should have that right now if you don't then something's off and i'm sorry
i can't fix your problems probably on the fly
but at this point you should have that get tab
all right so what's next install a package we are going to click on oh you can't
see it because i'm in the way the beauty of live is i can make these
changes on the fly there we go i'm a little bit smaller now
okay so click on packages which is right here
we're going to install and we're going to install the blog down package
you also might need to install dev tools so
you could it could ask you to install dev tools d e v l let's see if i can
zoom in on that um i'm not gonna do that right now but
you might have to so let's try blog down and i've already i didn't uninstall

00:18
these packages so that's why i can't test to see if i needed dev tools or not so
my blog down it says successfully unpacked an md5 sum checked
if that's the case for you good if it asks you for
dev tools go ahead and install that and then install blog down
so that's installed good to go now let's install the hugo themes so blog down
colon colon install hugo that's what we want to do so everybody
can see that i hope you install the hugo and hit enter
and here is where it's going to make it so that we can use
the hugo theme set for building websites hopefully you have a good um setup
right now where it's all still working notice this version right here
that's going to come back later i'll show you how to get that again anyways but
the latest hugo version is point zero point 0.72.0 the entire thing matters

00:19
so there's that got that hugo installed we're good to go
next step next step see if i can remember all these next steps
the next step would be to actually create a
site using blog down but before we do that let's check out a website here
called hugo themes so i'm going to show you this url themes dot
go hugo dot io forward slash tags forward slash blog i'm sure you can
get to it either way i just happen to click on blog that's
why it's there you can do just themes.gohugo.io and you'll get here
i clicked on blog as a there we go i clicked on blog right here
to get me to this page and i'm going to choose and i have not tested this one
out yet i just looked at it and i said oh that looks pretty simple to use
i'm going to choose this one here called m10c

00:20
let's see if you can get it a little bit better m10c
so click on that and this is how it's going to work for all of your hugo
themes so you can pick all of these different themes and it's just going to work
hopefully so here we are we are i've clicked on the theme of my choice
now i want to click on home page you can click on the demo and see what
it's like first in fact let's do that real quick
so here's what it looks like it's pretty basic it looks like um
it's got uh you could put a picture there a little title a couple of links
to github or twitter i'm sure there's actually
options for facebook and other things as well we'll figure out
but then you have your blog post here and if you click on one it's working
it's probably got some code it's probably get some math in there
somewhere that's not important right now but what's important is that you
actually can find this on github and that it's maintained right so every
every single theme is not treated equally uh look for when it's updated updated

00:21
2020 6 7. so it's probably actively being updated which is great
that's good to know all right so we're going to go to home page like i said
and you can see now this is a github site just like the one you just created
except this one's got the actual theme here what you want to take notice
is the username and the theme name or the repository
name so we're gonna we're gonna copy that we're gonna copy that whole thing
here ctrl c or command c maybe if you can get it okay so that's what we needed
so now we go back to our studio if i could find it there we go i'm gonna
see if anybody uh oh no worries i'm coming late this is all um gonna be recorded
and sent back on youtube you'll be able to catch up
all right so the next step is boom boom boom what was my next step
we installed hugo now we need to actually create a blog okay

00:22
so blog down and every once in a while i gotta check to make sure i'm still
recording and i don't like the way that i look right now
with my camera that's not cool because i there now you can see like my head a
little bit sorry slight distraction guys i uh i'm a
little bit weirded out the way that my head is that's weird i'm weirded out
let me try something here oh well leaving it all right blog down colon colon
and then we're going to do oh build site no site
new site new site always difficult theme equals right and in quotes or single
quotes that's where we're going to paste that guy's uh the

00:23
author of the site and the theme name whoo
so i did control v on that and added a couple extra spaces or
indentations and return care characters so
i deleted all that so now we're down to just
what we need that should do it we'll see let's double check by hitting enter and
just see see what we get um argument one matches multiple formal arguments
well what does that even mean and i don't think single quote versus double
quote matters this is where argument 1 matches multiple formal arguments
oh i think it's supposed to be a dash i am sorry
boom boom dash these are the little things oops spoke too soon
all right let's try this again oh it's definitely not a dash

00:24
going back to the site here hold up vaga just for just for my sanity i think i
might pick a different one just to see if it's me or
something else that's causing this it shouldn't be though
like the one that worked last time was the academic site and i really wanted to
show you a different one um academic no i can't look at it that way you know
that should work let's troubleshoot this some more sorry guys a new site
oh theme is spelled wrong guys come on where's my chat where's my help
in the chat room for that just kidding so i did theme spelled
incorrectly and that was probably the problem so it probably isn't that dash
and it's the forward slash like i originally thought
all right we're going to press enter on that and hopefully you guys see what i
just fixed and it's starting to download what i need to download and create the

00:25
site so give it a few seconds there we go
here we go everything's looking good now finally
that was a little scary for a second going live and messing up
big time all right so we have a site here and you can kind of mess with it in
this view right here you can click on things you can actually uh
check the website too so again if you guys are all here see that static or that
ip address it's colon forward slash forward slash and
then the ip address you can control c on that open up your browser
and paste it in there if you want to test it out that way
right so here it is this is local on my computer from r
the same exact site and the links should work everything working good
you can click the back button or do that um i think uh template primer i haven't
checked all this stuff out but working pretty good so that's a good
test run i'm going to close this i'm going to go back to our studio

00:26
and what i want to mention to you is a couple of things
the site isn't built this is all being basically
run through our studio right now in order to generate that site
ip address and to make it look like the site's built
it technically is not built and it would not work right so you need to build the
site before it works however you can do that for sure and
make it work locally on your computer right now it only works locally on my
computer through our studio if i closed our studio and found the folders
that it's created it's not going to work
correctly so just know that when i go to the public folder
which is right here don't mess with it right now because it it'll haunt you
and probably never mess with public honestly because
you want to build everything through rstudio and when rstudio does its thing
it's going to build it and put all the files necessary in the public folder
then let the public folder be used on the server that it's run which will be

00:27
netlafey for us that being said we are going to stop the server
just in case it has anything to do with um
what we're doing so i don't want it to interrupt anything we're doing so i'm
going to copy the serve r control c on that and i'm going to paste
it over here so it's basically going to stop the server and i've got that number
one in there as the parameter that says you know kill
exit right and we did not build the site keep that on in your mind all right we
stopped the server so now if you go back to that actual ip address it won't work
right it's still here over here in our viewer but it's not going to be hosted
on the actual site right here okay so now next step we've got a site
we saw that it works now we didn't change anything if you want to change
something like you know hello our markdown feel free don't mess up too much
until you kind of get used to it but let me show you a couple

00:28
things next we've built we've downloaded git we've
created git repository we've created a blog down site with a hugo theme
we've shown that it works we did not build it
now the next thing we're going to do is we're going to stage everything that was
created in this process to eventually commit to
github so that's what we're doing next all right now one caveat um if you stage
that public folder from rstudio oh you can't even see it there we go
wow that helps hero i'm down here now uh if you stage public if you click on
that little check box you're probably going to crash your system
so i really hope nobody's done that yet and just don't click it right now
you could try it out all you want on your own but right now
i'm not going to do it what you can do what i think i'm going to do is i'm
going to stage everything yeah let's do that so i'm going to go to tools shell
and in here hopefully i can get you a little bit closer

00:29
yeah i could do that and in here you should see that you're already in that
project directory so that's the beauty of going through
our studio as it puts you in the right directory we want to do [Music]
a couple of things first thing if you guys just downloaded git we have to set
up your git so while we're here let's do that
so before we do anything we're going to do git space config space dash dash
i'm reading this uh global my muscles global space user.name
space in quotes um the first name last name no no no no no no
username is exactly what you set up in your gitlab uh
get pages github pages github those are all actually three different things so
i got to be careful so in your github whatever username you have which mine was
my name basically mt gengrass so set that up

00:30
that's important hit enter hit the up key to repeat that instead of username
we're going to put in user email and then we'll put in your actual
email address here that you use for github so i'm gonna use the exact
one boom there we go i'm gonna hit enter on that and once you set that up
then we can do what i was about to do and that is
you wanna i'm gonna stage everything the reason why i'm doing it through the
shell the first time is because when you stage
a lot of files at once in our studio it sometimes crashes so i'm going to do it
this way the first time i'll show you again later
that we're not going to do this ever again including the username and email you
won't need to do that again all right so first we're going to do get space add
space dash capital a it's just going to add everything
probably not good practice for the long run but for now let's do that
and you can see it did a bunch of stuff a bunch of warnings the warnings have

00:31
nothing to do with what we're doing so i'm going to x that out
now you're going to see our studio catch
up let's see if i'm still with everybody a couple of people on
so now when i go back to our studio interesting i see a big black box
i will fix that i will fix that right now before it gets too crazy
sorry in fact what i'll do is i'll delete that little black box
maybe just a moment guys i got to fix something on the uh recording
it's always something you can never get it right
so there's a shortcut key i'm missing that didn't go with one of my

00:32
things i think yeah good for now we're back we're back we're back i believe
we are not back i'm deleting that thing neutral delete i hope that works and
everything else is fine all right all right we're good i'm sorry
guys got distracted all right so they're all staged they're all staged
let's click on oh geez i don't need that up there either let's click on commit
and you'll see everything is still checked off here we're going to say first
commit this message is used so that when you do the version control you can
always go back and see when you committed something what were the changes so
if you made like a change you can kind of describe what you did so that you can

00:33
always come back and version control it later so i'm going to click on commit
it's going to do its thing when you get this close button you're good to go
and then finally you want to push push so stage
commit push i'm pushing to github now that's the final answer
push so that one might take a few seconds because
uh the first time there's a lot of data that's never been in there remember we
started with an empty empty repository except for the readme
file but anyways the close button is available i'm going to click it
hit the x just to show you i'll go to my github account and this is what it
looked like before cradle to grave r i'm going to refresh that and now you
see all those files here including the public folder which we
never built the website just keep that in mind because i'm
i made a mistake before and okay so we've done that we've done that now
the next step this is just literally holding our stuff our files for us

00:34
now let's go to netlify so new site netlify www.netlify.com
and again you have to sign up if you didn't already it's free
and you'll probably be able to use your github account to actually sign up with
it so please do that and catch up uh with me after i'm going to log in because i
already have an account i think i guess i'll click on github
this should be a similar process and very simple uh for you guys as well
once you sign up so you've done the github you've already signed up and you
sign up for this you'll be able to connect to your github
it's going to ask you for permissions probably the first time it didn't ask me
but it probably asks you do i permission to look at your github
account and the answer is yes if you want to do this project
new site from git just like that i'm going to click on it
and continuous deployment git git lab or bitbucket i'm going to click on git lap
github this is how simple it is and again most
of these steps are the one time only now every update you make will be simple

00:35
you're going to be able to update your blog every single day no problem
it lists all of my projects i wanted to have it host cradle to grave r so i
click on that and there's some settings here i'm going
to see if i can zoom in a little bit there we go these are important all
right so i'm fine with the owner i'm fine with branch to deploy
down here in basic build settings make sure you have the build command
set as hugo and the publish directory as public
so that public is basically where it's going to publish everything live
and it's the first go-to place and then you want to click on show advanced
and when you do show advanced you should get this new variable here it's an
environment variable we need to set that up
when you set up at least one variable i hope click on new variable and we're

00:36
going to type in capitals hugo version all caps it matters and the value
that's that point that's at 0.72.0 and where do i get that from let's go
back to our studio real quick and let's just type in uh blog down hugo
underscore version right there this is pretty important
so now it shows you 0.72.0 so let's type that in in our little netlifie here 0.6
and that lead in zero does matter put that in
all right so that's it i'm going to deploy site and see what happens
it's not quite over yet we're almost there i mean we're pretty much there
right now but i'm going to click on this right now so i can see what's going on
i didn't have to click on it but i want to show you that it's deploying the site

00:37
right now doing all of these commands and it's building our site for us we
didn't build it in our studio we didn't need to
we never need to you can serve the site in rstudio so you can see if it's good
and if it's good push it to get which netliftee will go check
git and see if anything's changed if it's changed it's going to update the
site for you continuous integration continuous
deployment that's how it's going to be set by default
it's going to check every x amount of minutes to see if anything's ever changed
you can also manually click the retry button or the deploy button
finished processing build request in 34 seconds
i feel like it was even shorter than that that's it right
so now we can click on preview or yeah let's click on preview ooh
that's not good it did not work right so that i mean it's live but it's not
right if i click on something example domain i mean interesting bad deal there

00:38
what did we do wrong uh first i'm going to see if there's any errors in here
which i don't think no config file i knew that site is live
i gotta put my thinking cap on for this so we deployed it let's look at deploy
settings again um we have i know we created that environment
variable called hugo version but i want to say there might be another no
there might be something else in the deploy status we might build the site in
our studio and try it again so we can do that and see if that's the trick
let's try it let's try it that might be the problem so
this will show you also the continuous integration continuous deployment as well
so i'm back in our studio let me um put myself up here again i swear

00:39
my camera is either shifting downward or something
let's build a site we never built it so let's build it let's do
blog down colon colon build site and that's it
i tried it earlier and i used build site and it worked fine
but there's also a hugo build so i'd be careful with which one you pick i'm
using build site i'm gonna hit enter as you can see up here
i've just generated a bunch of modified files in my public area
um i'm going to push all of those to github in just a moment
let me jump down here again i don't want to risk crashing right now
but you could select them all individually there's probably plenty of
ways to do it i'm going to go to and as you can see they're all public
nothing's changed anywhere else i haven't done
any changes to the code the only thing i've done
was build the site which generates all the files necessary in the public i
thought that the um netlafy was going to do that and

00:40
maybe there is a way and it's we've got some sort of setting wrong but
let's try this and see if it fixes our site
um so i don't need to save anything but what i want to do is go to shell the i
mean tools shell and i'm just going to go ahead and do the get
space add space dash i could do a uh i'm just going to do the word public
forward slash star that means everything in the public folder
nothing else change there's no point adding stuff that didn't change
hit enter and i think we should be good to go let's jump back into rstudio and
you can see they've all been checked click on commit
click on uh or let's type in built site for the first time
using um build underscore site that way we kind of know not like
we're going to go back to it all right so it's been committed i'm

00:41
going to push it to github and once it pushes to github netlift
should see and recognize that it's changed and start the deployment process
for us let's go check maybe we can catch it in action
maybe so we're here we're going to go to uh deploys and you can see right now it
says building it already is building our site right now
whether it's going to work or not that's another story i'm going to click on it
and follow the commands just for fun just to see that it's still working
you'll get some failures in here probably here and there and you have to
figure out why but it is helpful to have this here so
you can copy and paste it and say hey why am i getting this failure and try to
get some answers but it says site is live let's try it
again let's hope that fixed our problem and it did not
that's not cool all right well where are we at where are we at good
thought though huh so that did not fix our problem well you guys are in a live

00:42
troubleshooting session now all right i'm gonna go to my deploys for another
let's see my deploys i think i have oh let me go all the way back
my project one test was working so i'm gonna click on that one and see
what kind of settings i might have that might be different i've got
and sadly it could be the theme itself that's causing the issue i don't know
but it worked fine in our studio so i don't think so okay so we have
all right build and deploy settings deploy key now environment hugo
underscore version 0.72.0 everything seemed to build

00:43
built fine though that's the problem i'm having
right i mean it didn't give us any errors whatsoever environment analytics
i don't know going back to this one let's click on site settings
again and double check we've got everything correct
i'm looking at build and deploy public hugo public so that seems to be correct
0.72.0 hugo version let's check github make sure that public
folder i'm sure it's there uh so there's a public folder there

00:44
three minutes ago it should be fine go back to rstudio
everything works here there might be a build local local equals true maybe
local equals false all right i'm gonna try one more thing and if this doesn't
work we'll have to come back and do this live thing again
we're close though we're close you guys got a lot pretty far
uh there's a couple other things i want to show you before i call it quits
anyways is first let's try this build one more time
blog down build site and then i'm going to put i think
local equals i think local equals false is the default it is the default so
that's what i was going to put local equals false that's not going to
fix it because that was the default so that's what we did let's see
thinking thinking anybody have any suggestions on the chat
well i'm thinking about that let me show

00:45
you another thing in netlify when you do get it working
maybe it's perhaps the theme i don't know but it worked with the other
project of mine so it could be the theme itself i don't
want to put blame on the theme though i don't i bet you it's anything it's user
error for sure all right so one thing that you want to do is check
your domain settings as well so let me go back to the overview tab here
and you see the domain settings click on domain settings
and you you can create your own domain or sub domain
and click on options edit site name and now you can put a more user-friendly
site name on there so i will call this i don't want to call it cradle to grave
r because i don't want to accidentally never be able to use that again so i'll
put a little one in there so i'm gonna hit save on that
and then that's our website so cradle to graver
one dot netliffy.app app click click on that

00:46
again something's wrong with our links and i'm not sure what that is let's see
every link is broken so there's a key every single link is broken let's do a
quick google um hugo site net netliffy every link broken what am i doing wrong
let's see solved solved hi hugo environment equals production did you go version
hugo underscore environment i didn't use an environment variable last time

00:47
double check one more here published failed failed
in the example below the publish directory is dist publish directory we
have public for hours so let's go back to netlify real quick
we did have public i'm certain so overview site settings
site details creatorgraver1 build and deploy hugo lower case
public lower case let's just go and double check yep hugo public base directory
nope that should do it that should be fine and we have our environment

00:48
variable here as hugo version v-e-r-s-i-o-n right that's how you spell version
and it actually doesn't give us an error so deploys
it says publish i'm going to click on it again
and read through this one more time well i'm gonna try one more thing and
then that's it and then if it's not then we'll call it quits and
try again maybe try a different theme all right so i'm gonna do clear cache
and deploy site one more time everything worked up until the end
though so i'm pretty happy about that i just didn't want to waste a whole lot
of time not having the solution for you but considering you know it's live you

00:49
never know what you're going to get i do hope that people can get value out
of this as you know as much as they can up until this point
soon though because i in my tutorial i show how to do this and it works fine so
what's probably gonna happen is someone's gonna look at the last
tutorial and say here's what you did different
and hopefully solve the problem so i'm going to click refresh here just to see
if it changes so it says published i'm going to click on it and click on
preview again and no go no go no go what we could do
is probably google that exact theme whatever it was called um let's go to
rstudio and check it bothers me a little bit that we
couldn't get it completely working what do we do for theme oh i'm lost here too

00:50
blog down download the blog down create the gray bar our theme should say
somewhere around here live streaming let's see hugo themes what did we use
for a theme i forgot the name of the theme guys
not a big deal like i said i think we've covered everything up to that point and
it it's at least live but it's not looking correct and i know
i know there's some issues what how do we fix that issue

00:51
block down build site hugo version demon stop
this is where that book's going to come in handy
theme vaga hugo theme i'm just going to double check
if maybe other people are having issues with this particular theme
i kind of doubt it i do think it's user error
yeah i don't see a whole lot of people having this problem so i think we will
still call this one quits and try it again i'd like to try it again and be a
little bit more streamlined with this what other build could we do all right
let's go to that book i'll show you that book that i was reading to get all this
information that was the uh where is it at
right here so on the left hand side we can easily just scroll down to

00:52
deployment netlify and this gives us some instructions um i don't know if you
guys can see it let me see if i can do a shortcut to get it closer not quite
i'm in the way as well all right there we go let me just zoom in that way
branch master build command hugo publish directory public
hugo version and that's it that should be it all right maybe it's

00:53
not the deployment it is configuration static sites in hugo oh
relative urls equals true let's try this one last thing all right
so what i didn't show you before was the files here over here you see the files
and i have a config.tomo file it's a i don't know what it's another markdown
language but inside of here you have a bunch
of parameters that you can set to change like your github and your twitters
and add things and subtract things and you know there's all kinds of stuff in
here we can add a parameter here called relative urls equals true i wonder if
that's our problem so i'm going to control
s hope you guys are still following me along on this one ctrl
s you see that my config.tomo file showed up over here
so now i'm going to show you that you can just click it to stage it and it

00:54
should be fine so click it staged commit i'm going to say change relative urls
to true i think this is our problem i am sorry that it took so long to get there
and i'm already putting the cart before the horse by saying it's fixing it but
who knows did i push it pushed it again cool everything's up to
date uh just a little side note as well uh when you open up our studio tomorrow
the next day and you start making changes to
this particular code before you even do any of that
click this little down arrow and that's pulling the latest version from github
otherwise you're gonna you're gonna run into problems like uh because it's not
gonna be synced up and you'll have to google how to fix
that because it's a good thing and it's purposely done to you know not make you
screw things up but it will kind of uh set you up set you back a little bit
because you'll have to google how to do it anyway so we did that

00:55
let's go back to our netlify and see if that fixed the problem
um i'll click refresh no go on the refresh close that go back here i'm gonna do
that whole um delete the deploy and or the cache and do it again so we have
the latest one trigger deploy clear cache and deploy site
last try then i'm calling it quits we were so close and anybody that's
still sticking with me now to this point troubleshooting this very last bit i
appreciate it but i will probably have to do this one more
time in the future and make sure i get it streamlined enough that i can just
zip right through it maybe 35 minutes it says live let's preview it
and no go sorry guys i failed you on the very last part but you do have
up to there to work with and i hope that you come back let's see what is that

00:56
site cradle to grave our nether fee yep no go no go let's go back to me
i tried and i failed um hopefully i can edit this
down and use most of it but if not i'm not worried about it because i feel like
i feel like because of that mistake at the end i should have tested out this
theme beforehand is key um so we'll do this again in a couple of days
hopefully i'll get some more people that are interested and go from there so
sorry once again uh you saw some live troubleshooting that did not work for
the very ending but i will see you guys on the next one byeEnd of file
