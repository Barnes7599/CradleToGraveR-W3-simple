[Music] you [Music] okay this is my my livestream for our
and I have just set this all up on Windows as some of you know I have been
on a MacBook and I still am using a MacBook I'm just trying to make a
different workflow right now so my workflow is going to be record and do

00:03
all of the programming on a PC with Windows and as soon as the record is
done it'll drop it right into my MacBook folder and then I can throw it into
Final Cut Pro and edit it but the goal is to be able to do more not necessarily
lie that it's but the minimal amount of editing in general so I'm trying to
streamline that slowly but surely it's getting there I'm just practicing right
now with with my PC setup alright so that being said let me talk to you about
what we're going to talk about today we are going to be using our and our studio
tools to unzip a directory full of files automate automatically so let me go
ahead and show you an example set of files literally I just put this PC
together and I'm using it and so I'm downloading all these things I need as
you can see in my downloads folder I have tests and then a few other zip
files in there now I don't really need these anymore this is just an example

00:04
but imagine you had 50 or 60 zip files or maybe somebody at your work Center is
sending you zip files every day daily and they've accumulated 230 for the
whole month and you need to unzip each one well instead of going to the right
click extract all clicking all these buttons and waiting you know and then
having all these pop-ups come up for 30 different files we're gonna do this
automatically with our so this is a little bit of a deviation from
statistics and machine learning and things like that but these tools are
super helpful that I figured I'd throw this in there in the mix just to show
you how to do it because it's really simple honestly and with that being said
let's do a couple of preliminary things just to get you started you might need
you need the URL or the address of these the location or the path
and in Windows you have the path as just plain download so that's not really
gonna help you too much you can right-click on the files that

00:05
are in this location and click on properties and then we can see down here
where it says location you can usually get an idea of the location that way we
can go ahead and copy this entire location here highlight it and do ctrl C
let's just keep that so now that we have this let's go back to our studio and
what you're gonna notice too is that I actually have our version 4.0 installed
if you don't that's fine as long as you have a three-point-something version
this should work so I'm gonna go ahead and go down to line 2 here I'll zoom in
a little bit for ya so as you can see I'm gonna create a directory so we just
we just found that so we'll call it my directory and we're gonna set that equal
to our path but we want to put it in quotes as well so keep that in quotes
and then finally we don't need to see colon so delete that and remember
backslashes like this are actually escape characters so you can either put
a double backslash for each one or you can convert them all to forward slashes

00:06
I'm gonna go ahead and convert them all to forward slashes and you don't need
one at the very end here so that's fine so we've got that that's fine so that's
a placeholder for our directory now what we want to do is I'm gonna show you how
to download a tool that's gonna help you call plier so click on packages down
here and then click on install and just type in make sure your repositories
crayon type in P l yr p ly r and it's the plier library now mine's gonna
install to the default library which is my 4.0 you might have a three point
something in there that's fine just click on install it's gonna take a
few seconds to install and then you should be good to go
make sure install dependencies is also checked that way if it requires other

00:07
libraries it'll go ahead and download those as well alright
now that we have that yours should be loaded by now we're gonna add that
library so library P Lyr and do control enter on that to load the library
control enter on my directory you can see on the right hand side down here you
have my directory stored my shortcut keys ad minus and plus and things like
that unto the R so don't worry about that I just delete them okay so let's
get going here we want to get a list of those zip files right so let's just
create a list called zip file and this would be the list of files so a
convenient thing that R has built in is list dot files so we're gonna use that
function and we're gonna say ok what's the path where do we want to look at
those files when I say path is equal to and our path is our my directory path so
we can make that into my directory no problem there and we want it to only
list files at a zip file so let's let's add a pattern our pattern is equal to in

00:08
quotes star dot zip so the star if you don't know stands for basically a
wild-card but it's it's as many letters or characters to the left of that star
or the left of the the period actually it'll grab as long as it has a dot zip
extension at the end that's all that's saying I'm sure you've seen that before
all right so then we'll do what we need to put in full names equals true fold
that names that way it gets the entire so because we need to doing this we can
do it'll actually just do users mark G downloads slash filename one does if
instead of finally one does it final name to does it find them three does if
we're gonna have it have the entire path so that's why full names equals true
it's usually a general bit safer to do because if if if the function doesn't
actually know to use a local directory then it'll take care of it for you
because it's gonna give you the entire path and I'll show you that in just a
second so on number six I'll hit come in

00:09
I'll hit ctrl enter let me zoom back out for you now you can see up here on the
right-hand side I have zip file it's got three files in there we can go down to
our command or our console and just type in zip underscore files
file hit enter and you can see the entire path inside a quotes
users mark G downloads all of them are in there so that's what it did pretty
simple straightforward now that we have that now we're going to use this cool
powerful thing called you know the player package I'm gonna use L D ply
which stands for kind of like l'p lida plier and l'p ly is hey let's apply a
function or a set of rules to every single thing in the list and then bring
it all back together so the plier function and the plier package is really
meant for us taken like a list of objects doing something to each one and
then putting them back together that's all we're doing it's real simple so
we're gonna set our data is equal to and our data is actually equal to our zip

00:10
files we want to send in our zip files but now we're gonna say what do we want
to do with these if owls we're gonna apply a function so the dot fun and then
the function is called unzip and that's just part of the our base package so you
don't have to download anything for this I don't think it's part of plier but
it's it's it could be I'm not a how to ensure on that and then we have to give
it a directory to actually unzip these two so we're just gonna do the same
directory so I'm going to call it my directory again and that should do it so
let's go ahead and cut ctrl enter on that actually let me show you my
downloads again so you should see my downloads here I'll kind of I'll try to
bring it up quickly when I run this to see it working so let's go ahead and do
ctrl enter on that and I'll do alt tab and you can see it was that quick it
actually just did that so I have three new files here that was are all unzipped
really fast and all automated that's it that's all there is to it it's extremely

00:11
simple to do I hope that you can find our in our studio to be useful not only
for your statistics or any type of program that you you want to do but use
it as a tool in your work area to automate the boring stuff automate the
boring tasks anyways if you find this helpful please like and subscribe but
more more importantly if you can share this on social media that would be great
share it on Twitter Facebook anything that you have
let's see oh and finally if you thought this was helpful there's an actual
playlist that I'll bring up and it's got practical art for business it's not
really meant as statistics or anything like that so let me bring it up here so
this right here is my playlist it's got Flex dashboard it's got our
studio shortcut tips but these particular videos and tutorials are
meant for somebody that's in the business realm that wants to automate
some of the boring stuff so that's it and this was my first live stream on the

00:12
new computer I was rushing for it I'm not quite set up completely the way I
