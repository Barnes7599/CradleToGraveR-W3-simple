we are going to create a linear model based on some fake data and then we'll
actually predict the future future data excuse me and just go from there so
let's start off with first creating some
random data frames so I'll do an example data frame look I know my do is example
data whatever you wanted to call it so my example data is gonna consist of a
data frame so like a spreadsheet looking
things so here's my data frame and again this is live and I might make a few

00:01
mistakes but bear with me we're gonna have a data frame we just make this up
as you know we could say let's say there's a how about I don't know
Kovach cases and death rate that sounds terrible but why not covet cases equals
and we'll just make that just purely made up so the kovin case is maybe it's
per per week per day per month whatever you want to call it let's just say 100
200 400 you know kind of X you know maybe won't make them so multiples of
each other like exactly maybe 723 something like that let's just
make this a little bit off you know 409 185 something like that and we just have
four four data points so four days worth of deaths so the first day was 100 the
second day was 185 409 and 723 so how many Cova deaths did we have well we

00:02
have Kovach deaths and again I'm just making these numbers up so we have you
know wait 100 cases maybe we had one death and then weighed 185 we had a
three deaths and then maybe ten and of course one legs the other etc you know
but whatever the numbers might be I'm just making this up okay so let's say we
have this so we have our data frame let's do command enter on that and
you'll see hopefully let me check something here yeah so you can see up in
the top right that I have my example data for observations of two variables
so I click on that and I might be able to zoom in for you
let me see yeah there we go so we have Kovac cases and you see our data
it's Kovac cases and Kovac deaths we have four observations all right so
let's go back to the actual code and we have so once we have the data we need to

00:03
come up with some sort of model right let me just so we come up with a model
by doing you know model 1 whatever you want to call it model 1 is equal to it's
gonna be a linear model and now I'll just linear model to be based on I want
to predict how many deaths based on the cases that's just what I'm gonna come up
with so let's just do so the response variable would be kovat deaths right and
what explains that they explained a variable will be the kovat cases and
what data am i using so data equals and it'll be my example data and that's it
so command enter on that we have a model 1 now again we can check out the
coefficient C OEF model underscore one command enter and you have an intercept
of negative seven point one and a a slope excuse me a slope of point zero
five four right now we can plot that but we have to load
our library remember library ggplot2 so load that if you don't have it if you're

00:04
just joining this live feed which I don't do in this channel very often you
go to packages over here OOP you can't see that actually so let's just go ahead
and zoom out hopefully I'm just making sure that my my view is there for you
guys I don't cover anything up that you need you would click on packages here
and you'd go to install and just type in ggplot2 and select it and then click
install that's if you don't have it which I think most of you should have it
so I'll leave my picture up there alright so we have our ggplot let me see
all right so now we can use it now that we have it and we'll do a
do plot of the example data that's what we want right we'll make the aesthetic x

00:05
equals Cove of death Snoke Ovid yeah we want Kovac cases on the excess of access
kovaydin cases X data kovat cases yeah and the Y is equal to Co vyd deaths all
right and of course yeah that's our aesthetic that makes sense parentheses
parentheses and we want to add a geometry to it G on point so just
basically a data a scatter plot and then we can do jump smooth if we'd like G on
smooth that way we get some cool looking graphs and the method is gonna be equal
to LM linear model we're doing linear simple linear models and we might need
to I've had a feeling I did something wrong but anyways that's our data points
so we have one two three four points four points and we want to predict later
on so let's you know it's not quite linear you can see some data points are

00:06
not touching the line and then of course you have your confident I've percent
confidence interval is that that gray that darker gray so there's a 95% chance
that another point would land within those lines but there is a 5% chance
that will land outside of those that dark gray area simple enough right
simple enough so cool we've got that but now the question is how do we predict
what would happen with something we don't even have right now right so we're
gonna do that right now we're gonna say hey I've got more data that I think it's
gonna happen based on what else whatever
scenario I want I know so we'll just say you know more data and we'll set that
equal to it we're gonna set that equal to a list and we'll say we have Co vyd
cases equals and it's a vector of numbers so let's say we have 1,400
we have 2,500 what happens if we have a million right what happens if we have

00:07
all those cases so this is what I want to do I want to say hey there's more
data out there so I'm gonna run that so more data is now equal to a list of of
kovat cases right but without the deaths
we don't know we just don't know so what we'll do is we're gonna actually create
a predict variable so predict one I'm just naming this now is equal to my
predict function I'm gonna predict based on the model I just created which the
model is model one mo de O underscore one so based on that model and my new
data which is so new data you have to populate that with well it's more data I
have more data and that's what it is and
then of course we can do interval equals prediction that's what we want to
predict I think that's by default too but I'm
not sure I'm percent so predict one is that so if I hit enter or command enter
on that stores predict one and we can say that if we just type it out predict

00:08
one come and enter you see you've got three rows right and so those three rows
represent the three new kovat cases and their corresponding output so fourteen
hundred aligns with the 69 2500 lines with 129 and the 1 million lies with the
54,000 636 so that's what you predict using a linear model so using those
coefficients remember we saw the coefficients up here somewhere if we
actually plugged in this formula we're covert cases is the variable so so
if I type that out let's see if I can memorize it well I'll just type it out
again let's do coefficients again so if I literally did you know this is not
gonna run but Cova deaths equals and the
formula would be the remember a negative B or host I was gonna give you the
quadratic formula remember the formula y equals MX plus B right and so the M the
slope is the point O five so Oh point zero five four six times the number of

00:09
cases so in this case we had the cases was fourteen hundred for the first one
fourteen hundred plus the intercept which was negative
27 so plus or we can just say minus seven point 107 right
let's see if I can actually I never actually do so I'm gonna get rid of
covert kovat deaths and see if this actually give me a answer sixty nine
point three three all right so if I typed out all the rest of the
significant digits it would have equalled sixty nine point
three nine whatever that is right that's it I just wanted to show you guys a
quick way to predict because on the previous tutorial I did not do that I
literally left you hang in with hey here's a linear model cool play with it
and I showed you how it works with the equation and how to create that line but
I didn't I didn't actually show you how to add more data to see what the
prediction is so in the next video I have to keep this one short but in the
next video perhaps we'll plot those new points and
go from there and then we'll also do multi linear regression where we have

00:10
more than one variable that can predict the response which will be pretty
interesting so anyways this was my first live live video let's see if I could
switch to full screen on me I'm just messing around with my live content
thanks for watching and I appreciate everyone that comes out here to actually
give me comments and they share my videos you guys are definitely making me
more motivated to do more of these and I appreciate it I am NOT a statistician
I'm not an expert expert but I hope that I can convey the message of hey what
this stuff means maybe you can take it and become a extraordinarily data
extraordinarily good data science or get that job be a citizen data science
either way so I appreciate it and I will see you guys in the next videoEnd of file
