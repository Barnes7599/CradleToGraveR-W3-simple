In this series of tutorials, we'll cover the basics of R programming and RStudio. By the end of this lesson you'll know:

Basic math operations in the RStudio
Where your variables are stored
How to create and run your first R Script

I'm assuming that you've already installed R and RStudio, and the tutorial is going to cater to people who already have a little programming experience. It's not essential that you have this, but a little bit of math knowledge or logical thinking will get you through. Let's get started!
