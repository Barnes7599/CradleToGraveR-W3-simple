welcome back everyone thanks for sharing
and liking my video tutorials because I noticed there’s definitely a gain in
traction on my channel so thank you for that today we’re going to talk about
linear regression but more specifically multi linear regression previously we
talked about how an explainer variable can actually help you figure out what
the response number is so if I wanted to say hey the miles per gallon can be
explained by the displacement or the miles per gallons can be explained by
the weight we’ve only really taken into account one feature to be that explainer
so in this video I think we’ll maybe dive a little bit more into using more
than one feature to see if if they’re relevant in our predictions let’s just</p>
<p>00:01
start slow and we’ll get back to that so let’s do my data is equal to empty cars
our favorite data set right so just load that data in there let’s take a quick
peek at it I’m just gonna click on you can see well no you can’t I’m gonna
click on it you know where it is by now but I’ll go ahead and put me down here
so miles per gallon you know it’s it’s the first column of data here with the
various vehicles we have cylinders displacement horsepower drat all these
things I want to be careful though some of these are not actually numeric they
look numeric cuz they’re numbers but they’re actually categorical variables
like gear and carb there’s no 4.1 or 4.3 it’s not really a numeric it’s a
category it’s hey this has four gears this has three gears this has five years
right and they can’t be anywhere in between so we just have to be careful and
cognizant of that as we pursue this so we’ve got an idea of what kind of</p>
<p>00:02
features we have and again we really don’t need to start doing anything until
we still we plot these so let’s go ahead and add our library ggplot2 command
enter on that and let’s just go ahead and plot a couple of these just for our
sanity and so we’re gonna do a ggplot and we will do the data is
equal to my data that’s my pretty much that’s how I do it aesthetic we want the
x axis to equal let’s try displacement first and then
the y we’re gonna predict so the response is the Y is the miles per
gallon simple enough now don’t forget we have to add a geometry to this layout
and that was gonna be G on point for a scatter scatter plot and that’s about it
for now it’s just to run that I will disappear and move away from the plot
area I’ll leave it small this time but you can kind of see looks like</p>
<p>00:03
displacement on the horizontal axis and miles per gallon you can all you could
kind of fit a line through there right you can see it’s a downward slope you
know so if I think I have it back that’s do it backwards on the camera but it’s
it’s a negative slope so there’s a negative relation as displacement goes
up miles per gallon goes down okay cool now let’s just play around let’s change
it to weight instead of displacement WT and we’re just exploring here that looks
like it could be a linear relationship as well let’s try drat and these are
just random I don’t want to do that the features yet but the dret does not look
linearly correlated so that’s the key linear means they fall in a line it does
not look like drat is linear you can just look at that and tell all right
knowing that let’s just play around a little bit here
let’s change well keep those drat let me</p>
<p>00:04
show you something here now let’s create a model with the draft and only one
variable so it’s just a basic linear model so we’ll call this model 1 and
we’ll set it equal to the linear model of we want to explain miles-per-gallon
explained by the tilde just draft and of course our data is equal to my data
simple enough I’m just gonna show you a couple things to help you along here so
let’s type in model 1 you gonna see the equation down at the
bottom is you have an intercept and a and a weight to put on to drat right
that weight that you put on to drat is like the slope because there’s only one
there’s only one weight and that’s on drat okay so we have that that doesn’t
tell us a whole lot now so let’s just do a summary of model one summary of model</p>
<p>00:05
one and run that now at the bottom hopefully you could see it I did the
summary and it gives me the formula of the residuals the median all that but
what I’m interested in is the p values right the p statistic now I know you
don’t you might not know what that means and that’s fine that’s perfectly fine
let me zoom in on the right spot here so
these p-values here you can see that the intercept doesn’t have one but the
intercept really doesn’t count so ignore
that but the drat it does have a p-value so this PR it’s actually stands for a
probability the probability that it’s greater than a certain threshold right
and so for now for today let’s just pretend that you know everything about
that and these three these three stars mean oops I’m clicking on the wrong
thing and these three stars mean that it’s statistically significant right but
let’s not forget what we did here we only had one variable to explain miles</p>
<p>00:06
per gallon and that was Draft so it really didn’t have much to go by so this
is not that useful yet okay so just keep that in mind we’re gonna
use this in just a little bit let’s go ahead and change it from drat back to
wait WT I’m gonna run the plot again so we can see the plot so there’s the
weight and now in the model one let’s go ahead and change that drat to wait come
and enter let’s see what the equation is
do you see there’s an equation there and
then the summary so again we have weight here instead let me blow it up for you
we have the WT and we have three stars here right just like drat so they’re
both statistically significant now I’m gonna show you something that’s gonna
maybe blow your mind maybe not in fact I don’t know the answer yet but I’m</p>
<p>00:07
guessing based on the plot of drat it looked like it wasn’t linear so I’m
going to add in my model so you can see right here in my model I only have
weight now how do we add the drag to that all we do now you’re gonna be like
oh that was easy + drag done model 1 command enter we can get an equation
wait did that take something something might have enough let me try this again
I’m an actor error error drag not found Oh drat
shoot thought I was going crazy for a second drat ok drats that’s what some
people would say model 1 now we could see it it shows both the weight and the
drat weights now wait wait wait but you get what I’m saying the parameter weight
and the WT we’ll call it beta 1 and the drat will called beta 2 the beta 1 for
weight is negative four point seventy three the beta 2 for the drat wait is</p>
<p>00:08
one point four four - okay cool still not that impressed yet but now let’s do
our summary come and enter on that and I’ll zoom in now let’s take a look here
the three stars remember I said to kind of ignore the intercept don’t worry
about that so much now wait has the three stars but drat doesn’t notice that
okay now remember as I was saying the the weight was significant and we saw on
the chart on the plot that it was pretty much linearly lined up we’d all fairly
well drat was not but when I gave them independently to the models they’re
significant because there’s nothing else to go by there’s literally nothing else
to go by so when you put them together there’s more statistics going on in the
backend more probabilities and it decides based on that p-value</p>
<p>00:09
that probability value that probability which we’ll get into in probably the
next tutorial maybe we’ll start talking about hypothesis testing and whatnot so
I’m a little out of out of out of line here but just know that the ones with
the stars are the ones that you probably want to focus on to be statistically
significant what this is telling you now let me let me zoom in just a little bit
what this is telling you is that they’re saying that the drat is not explaining
the miles per gallon nearly as much as the weight but when you had that alone
that was all I had to go by it had to say was it was statistically significant
right and so when you have both of them together it’s basically telling you do
you want a complicated equation or do you want to make this a little bit
easier because don’t get me wrong we’re never gonna be a hundred percent correct
but think about it if you have five hundred variables to pick from instead
of just two and you start saying well the computer gave me a result but then</p>
<p>00:10
you have to calculate that result for thousands of entries possibly right and
that takes compute time and cycles and that could get very complicated very
fast it’s hard to explain that to somebody
oh these 500 variables are causing this you know the revenue to go down right
that’s very difficult but if you can really narrow it down to just a few
explaining variables that truly have an impact that’s much more powerful for
decision makers so let’s think about it that way and that’s really what I wanted
to show you we can add let’s go ahead and add one more to this we have wait
drat and let’s add what was another number let’s take a look at the model no
not the model the data okay now the number is Cusack we can do
Q SEC or just see already did displacement let’s take a look we didn’t
do displacement let’s do displacement just for fun so we’re gonna create a new</p>
<p>00:11
model its model 1 still because I’m overriding it but keep that in mind
model 1 it shows us an equation but again the equation doesn’t tell us a
whole lot except for the fact that display negatively correlated and it’s got a
pretty small number let’s do the summary let’s see what really matters
scrolling down or up intercept ignore wait now all of a sudden the wait has
only one star instead of three the drat has none and the displacement
has a point which the point I think means significance yeah so there’s our
number a special number that people like to use is 0.05
when this p-value is less than 0.05 they typically will say it’s statistically
significant now I’m not gonna tell you exactly what all that means yet because
it all depends on the circumstance right you like you want your airplane to be -
never - never crash so 0.05 percent failure would be pretty terrible still</p>
<p>00:12
right so it all depends in context but in general people tend to use a point O
5 as a threshold to be statistically significant or not and we’ll talk about
null hypothesis and reject in the hook the nulls in another episode tutorial
but that’s it that’s what I wanted to show you was as you add different
features to your model it doesn’t necessarily make the model before that
any it doesn’t have any relationship with the model before that right so the
relationships all vary based on what you
put in them they can all be great models in fact we still have no idea which
model I know I call them all all model one which maybe should have kept them
separate we still have no idea which model is the best model because we
didn’t actually do any predictions with this so we’ll get into that too but that
was the majority of this tutorial it was just to kind of give you an idea of you
can add features to these linear models sure but again scatter plots are really</p>
<p>00:13
important because we’re doing linear modeling we’re not doing some crazy
victor polynomial modeling this is just pure line what line will go through
these things so again we did their aesthetic with weight and miles per
gallon that looks good but let’s go back to drat and I’ll show you again that
it’s not that linear that’s why it’s probably not that significant right
compared to the other compared to the other features that’s
you get a note now one more thing just because I’m it’s on my mind right now is
I’m not sure if I showed you how to add a color to a ggplot based on a factor so
remember I said like gear in carb we’re not really numbers like you can’t have a
7.5 carb or whatever a2 gear it’s only 3
4 &amp; 5 gear right according to the data
so in our aesthetic just for fun just to put some color on our thing here let’s
just do color equals and we’ll set it equal to deer right now there’s a
problem with that so I’ll definitely show you let’s see if I can zoom in on</p>
<p>00:14
this maybe maybe maybe a different screen ok anyways I’m in the way so I’ll
get out of the way and we have our color
gradient here and again you can see some
decimal values and that’s not cool so we did something wrong here so let’s go
back if I can find it let’s go back and instead of using color
equals gear we’re gonna say color equals as dot factor gear add another
parentheses command enter on that fact I wonder if the zoom is still there if I
come over here yep so you can see you can see that now it’s as a factor you
only have 3 4 &amp; 5 so 3 colors now the
size is pretty small we can fix all that
too but I just wanted to show you how to do that before we go too much further
hope I didn’t confuse you too much we’re gonna make these more clear throughout
the next couple tutorials again thanks everyone for sharing this thanks for</p>
<p>00:15
liking it I’m seeing some growth I definitely enjoy that and I will see you
in the next episode in a few days probably you [Music]End of file</p>
