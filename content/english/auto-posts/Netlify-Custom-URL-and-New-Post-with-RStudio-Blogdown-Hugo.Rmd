all right now that we've got our site up and live let's customize that URL to
make it a little bit more user friendly and human friendly and add a post simple
as that so let me jump right over to our studio you should be at this point
already have a project set up a blog down site built pushed to github and
pulled from net loafie and it should be live so this is tutorial number six
sorry about my hair it's been a couple of months now because of the pandemic
haven't had a haircut but this is tutorial number 6 so there are 6 total
if you want to start from the beginning that would probably be your best bet I
will at the end of all of this have a condensed version with every single step
included condensed but I still highly recommend going through the entire process

00:01
that being said here is my famous intro it's not much of an intro but what I do
is I create content online and then I teach you how I actually create that
content online so that you also can make
tutorials like this so I'll give you the
technology what I use and that's my blog site or my website mark Jin grass and
another YouTube channel this is the art channel so let's stick to that and what
we're gonna do is go back to the net Liffey site so you should have that up
it's just plain net leafy com so any T Nets lead com there we go right here
so login and you should get to a page where all of your sites that are
deployed are available as simple as that let's make this one quick and simple
click on the site that we just worked on which was for me the project one it
should be the top one most likely if you've been following okay now simple as
that let's figure out how do we get back to that site right so you see it right

00:02
here this is where the site is that's an ugly
looking website name so let's fix that click on domain settings and custom
domains now if you owned your site like cradle-to-grave
or calm or margin grass calm that's a different story
we're gonna use net low fee free version completely throughout this
tutorial and then later on in another tutorial I'll teach you how to add a
custom domain but what we want to do is just change this particular domain so
click on options and edit site name that's how simple it's going to be so
we're going to call this project 1 underscore I guess they don't like you
do want to score - test I don't know how many other projects throughout the
entire net Liffey ecosystem there are called project 1 slash tests so we might
run into a problem because as you can see you're still gonna have the dotnet
Lafitte ASE or a PP on there but I'll save it anyways and now our website is a
little bit more user friendly so you can totally share this website with anybody

00:03
in the entire world and it will be up and running now the
next part the cool part let's add a actual post to this site and had that
continuous integration continuous deployment set it all up for us let's
jump back to our project here here we are alright so the first thing we're gonna
do it's so simple we go to the add-ins you should have your project open your
project 1 or what have you called it as a blog down site alright so new post
simple as that new post and now it gives
us a bunch of options so let's give it a title we'll call this almost done
categories so whatever category you pick are our studio whatever you pick it'll
start to remember your categories and it'll give you the auto populated list
next time and same thing with tags what if you want to do now these are all fake
and I'm gonna delete all this so I'm not too worried about it
alright then you can post your filename it's automatically put there however if

00:04
you would like a different file name you can totally do that as well I would
research some SEO like some how do I create web sites that are easily
searchable by Google or whatever search engine you want to use right and use
that let's go ahead and click on our markdown only because the previous ones
are our markdown and I don't know if they work for everything yet I haven't
tested it you can test it out for me and let me know in the comments but anyways
I'm going to do our markdown and we'll go from there we'll go from
there so click on done alright so that's simple enough we have this new file
that's set up called 20 2006 13 almost done right this top part where the
dashes are that's your y Amal code with some of your metadata that you have like
the title the author those are all metadata for building the actual site so
let's go below the yamo and let's just start a double header here so header
header and just say header 1 and say this is some text I don't care I'm gonna

00:05
say header 2 now this is a markdown right so so we can get pretty
complicated with this we can add tabs we can add new pages I mean there's a lot
of stuff we can do but let's stick to some basic our markdown here and of
course your code can go here as well so let's do backticks
open bracket open brace our and then backticks to close it out I forget the
shortcut key it's I switch between a Mac and a PC and and I don't do this very
often so alright let's do my data is equal to the empty cars database and we
will also plot it and it should be a really good kind of a funky matrix plot
or some sort I'm gonna go ahead and hit that play button right here and we
should see the plot because it's an hour mark down or maybe if it's in our
notebook well okay I don't see it maybe it's cuz a mark down another notebook

00:06
file might be that case let's continue on anyways because I think it still
gonna work so ctrl s to save this so make sure it's saved before you do
anything let's jump back down to the console now another in the console let's
build rebuild the site you can see up here in the right-hand corner that as I
make changes anything that's changed that you're trying to push to github
will automatically appear here so you can stage it and commit it and push it
right so that being said let's build this site so blog down build build site
and let it run it's gonna make some changes to the public folder because
that's where it really all the action happens
that's quite a bit now again I used the shell to stage all this but there's not
that many here so let's try to do it manually okay I actually don't need to
stage the content I only need to stage the public stuff if you are sharing your
entire content your code everything on github you can share everything that's

00:07
fine but I can select just the public and it should still technically work but
it's got to be everything in public also using the command line is actually a
little bit easier than this because I can just say do the whole directory call
it call it good so I regret clicking these already but
that's okay almost there a static post I don't think we need that it's not in
public we only need what's in public so as you can see I only have public the
A's and the MS mean something I think modified versus added and there's a
couple other letters in there all right so that's what we want to stage we've
built it the key is going to build it first then stage it and commit it so
remember the name of this is called almost done I'm Oh before I do that
let's go back to here to prove that almost done does not exist I just
adjusted a test post a few minutes ago and almost done is not here okay so it's

00:08
non-existent let's see how fast this thing will work back to project click on
commit commit test live because this is I'm gonna not edit this at all guys and
push unless of course something drastic happens and I have to like go back but
there we go close exit I'm not even gonna check github because I'm really
caring about the actual site right now now it automatically detects net Lafitte
will detect did something change in my public folder and because I pushed it to
github the new stuff the new post it should have so I'm gonna click on
refresh and hopefully we see that almost done here which we do we do we do II
maybe he's a little bit too soon let's check over here real quick let's go to
our deploys here and this very let's see published commits lot commits to

00:09
life is here this was looks like it should be should be deployed so let me
click on academic let's click on posts test post that's not the what we called
it right I think we called it almost done let's double check again I think
okay it is called almost done and let's jump back this should be fairly simple
to fix I believe we should just mmm instead of maybe it doesn't check the
site that often so let's clear cache and deploy site now automatically there
could be some settings in there that make it check only every like hour ten
minutes I have no idea how often it'll ping that public folder to see if
there's any differences but it looks like the last deploy was 305 and it's
307 now so and it says published so it should have worked well let's just
double-check I'll refresh this and it says published let's try it one more
time or what site is this project one test yes

00:10
refresh test post you know I had this problem earlier I'm talking a lot hi my
first real post is the I'm gonna close it let's click on this post test post
not almost done hmm interesting interest and very
interesting let's click on this I'm gonna go to preview deploy it might be
something I'm missing test post okay back to our it is back to the editing
mode uh where did these come from oh those were there hmm interesting
all right I'll just let's just commit it all then why not commit test sorry
push I'm wondering one other thing I'm wondering if I actually do have to build
this site at all because I think maybe nettle if he does that for us

00:11
so maybe the public folder is not what they need but it's monitoring the public
folder so that's my thought process on that at least I thought they were
let's double-check to see if this works now let's redeploy and while it's doing
it I'll click on it so we could see what's going on see preparing installing
dependencies everything seems to be good checksum matched it's still going
everything looks good site is live site is live I don't know why they call it
preview maybe that's Hova it is a preview that
URL does not make sense for us because we changed it so posts almost done is
there whoo okay that's now we have to trouble sure to see if it's because it's
not really the public folder that you need in it and it's everything but the

00:12
public folder maybe I am sorry about that I think anyways let me close these now
that's a preview why didn't it work with our actual site name that we just
created let's double check just published its published it should be
this project one dot test I never fee posts almost done well maybe we have to
put everything in there instead of the public or including the public I don't
know and I'm sorry about that I hope this actually works for you I hope that
the previous tutorials worked in somebody comments showing that hey this
doesn't work for me so I can go back and fix it in fact they're not that hard to
do so if it is wrong I will probably redo that entire section of the video so
but I wanted to get you this far guys so there you are there you have it it
worked you see it's there it's under this URL

00:13
that's customized and the posts is there the almost done post and luckily the
plot showed up so we'll have to experiment with the our markdown
notebook and the MD files instead of the our MD files etc etc to see if they'll
all publish I don't know because I didn't build this theme right so well
keep exploring I hope this helps and you know please commit
to continuing to share my content to help this channel grow and I appreciate
everything you guys have been doing youEnd of file
