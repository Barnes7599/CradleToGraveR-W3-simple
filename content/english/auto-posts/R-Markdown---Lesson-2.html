welcome to the next lesson in this lesson we’re going to steer away from
our scripts and the console and we’re gonna go towards an R markdown file and
I’m going to show you how to create your
first actual project so I’m starting off
where we left in the last video with all
of this up I’m gonna go to file new file
I’m sorry new project and it’s gonna ask me if I want to save the current I
personally do not you can I’m just going to not save it now when new project
shows up you have a bunch of different options we want to probably put that
into a new directory and so we can keep it all collected in one little folder or
a set of folders and it’s going to ask you again what type of project do you
want we will get into some of these as we progress through this tutorial but
for now we’re going to go to new project right here so it’s a blank slate we’re</p>
<p>00:01
gonna give it a name I’m gonna call this our project 1 that way we can follow
along if we had have to come back to it now you’ll notice also that there’s a
open and new session if that’s checked it’ll keep my current environment and
all of this open and open up a whole nother instance of our studio and you
can actually run multiple projects side by side it’s not a problem but to keep
everything organized in this tutorial let’s go ahead and not check that box
and we’re gonna go ahead and hit create project it’s switching to a project view
now you’ll see we have our console window again it looks slightly bigger
before because remember I change the view to be have a bigger font for me my
environment still to the top right and my files plots packages all that is
still at the bottom right again we have a console we can do basic things like
2+2 we can even make assignments in there X is assigned to 23 and you’ll see</p>
<p>00:02
in their global environment X is equal to 23 I’ll show you a quick way to reset
all of these you click this little broom here and it’ll clear all your objects
from your environment click yes now if I hit X here it’s gonna
valuates a object that’s not found okay let’s not worry about that because what
we’re going to do is we’re going to create a new file in our project new
file and this time instead of in our script let’s go with our markdown now
it’s gonna ask us for a title for this we’ll just say whatever you want first
markdown file you can add in author anything else now the output format for
now let’s just keep it as HTML PDF and Word should work no problem but that’s
going to assume that you do have word and also that everything is kind of
working as you can see PDF requires something called miktex on Windows and</p>
<p>00:03
Mac Tex depends how you pronounce it so let’s stick with HTML just so that we’re
all on the same page PDF might work out of the box
we’ll see if not then we’ll actually mitigate that probably in another
tutorial let’s start with HTML hit OK and what we have here is we have our
console at the bottom still I’m going to resize this so that we can see more of
my actual our markdown now this is a I believe in RMD file yes our markdown so
its dot our MD when you save this right now it’s not saved we still have our
basic environment we have our bottom right let’s start at the top here of
what they generated for us when we created this markdown file these three
dashes and these three dashes is going to encapsulate our metadata for what
this document is basically on the HTML file the name of that file is going to
be under the title so you can call this whatever you want</p>
<p>00:04
Mark’s cool markdown file and that’ll be the title on your HTML document and you
can see the output is HTML document that came with the fact that we selected
those during the project settings do not mess with lines one through four except
for what’s in the quotes for now so let’s keep that there and you’re going
to see line six through eight has a weird knitter options trunk things like that
don’t worry about what all this stuff means yet let me walk you through this
file so limes six through eight are actually the only place in this document
that is actually code the rest is basically markdown language and metadata
metadata is going to be one through four and the markdown language is what you
see here like these two dashes means hey create a second level heading which you
might be you might understand from like Microsoft Word and I’ll show you how</p>
<p>00:05
that works in a moment and you have regular text you have some links and
that’s about it I’m sorry if you scroll down we have
more code and we know this is our code because it’s got the letter R inside of
this curly brace and it’s got these back ticks more on that in a just a moment
and so we have another header called including plots you can also embed plots
for example and then you have more code and the code is gonna do certain things
now let’s grow up let’s get straight to the point
the point is you can read this stuff and you can hit this little play button
it’ll actually play you see that little green thing that popped up there that’s
it it again and it actually ran everything within these back ticks and
the back pick is not a apostrophe it’s actually to the left of the number one
very important to know because they look the same especially if you’re cutting
and pasting from the web to our studio you’re going to be confused</p>
<p>00:06
so back tick and they have to be three and versus a single quote not single
quote you want backticks and they must have a opening set of back
ticks and then a closing set of back ticks so slide six and eight are
necessary if I get rid of these last any of the back text you should notice how
to change the color so there it is so you can tell that’s code because it
changes the highlight color okay we ran that we have a bunch of text we’re going
to run the next set of chunks and that’s
going to be a summary and as you can see it populated right here within our
document and including plots we can actually run a plot there it is there’s
a plot pretty cool because we have we have
actual words that isn’t code mixed with our code now how do we put this into a
very awesome HTML file we knit it seems little knit button right here let’s
click on knit to HTML and it’s gonna say
you need to save your file let’s save it</p>
<p>00:07
as first markdown file and it’s going to automatically put it in our our project
file for now that’s gonna be fantastic let’s just do that hit save and you’ll
see on the right-hand well first it pops up right here actually as a this is our
studio rendering the HTML file saying hey this is what it will look like when
it’s HTML so it’s pretty cool it doesn’t have those little hash hash marks it’s
got marks cool markdown file that’s the title that we put into the metadata we
have our markdown that was our header our second level header we have our text
we have links that work we’ve got an actual code in gray and here’s the
output of the code output of the code right here pretty awesome and that’s it
first our markdown file now if you actually want to look in the bottom
right-hand side you have more more files within that directory and it’s a little
weird to navigate but you can see my home’s home is right here then my our</p>
<p>00:08
project is right here so in your art project you should see all of your
project files what we generated when we when we knitted this was the HTML file
you see here first MD file dot HTML if I click on that you can open an editor or
you can view in a web browser it truly is an HTML file so if I open it in
editor it’s not going to look pretty it’s got the actual 18 HTML in there and
if you look at this it’s mindboggling lee complicated-looking
so close that out let’s click back on this and do view in web browser by the
way this is just a regular Chrome browser but you will notice on the URL
it’s actually on my hard drive but you can take this particular file you can
drop it into your word whatever website that you own and it’ll render
just like this as is so that’s one way you can publish it you can publish it on
github you can publish it on your own WordPress sites there’s definitely ways</p>
<p>00:09
to do all of that in fact once you get really good at are you will be able to
create a program that will automatically
push your our code into a wordpress site and I have a link for that too
ok that’s it for your second lesson that’s in our markdown file Mort I hope
this video was useful and if it was leave a comment below let me know how
