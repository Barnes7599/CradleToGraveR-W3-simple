so welcome back my name is marcin grass today we’re gonna start where we left
off on the previous lesson so if you haven’t seen the previous lessons please
go back and play catch-up we’re not very far so you can jump in
right here if you really need to we have an armed markdown file that is already
established for us because we created a new project called project one our
project files are here to the right and we have some code and our console at the
bottom what I want to show you in this particular lesson is some of the our
markdown capabilities that will create pretty cool HTML files previously we
created this HTML file let’s view that in the browser and we have some links we
have some headers we have some plots and
tables etc etc going back let’s say that we don’t want this link to be like that</p>
<p>00:01
what we can do is actually embed HTML within our markdown so instead of seeing
this we’re gonna say C and we’ll type in this link and we’ll make this link in
actual link using this time around actual HTML so we would actually do a
href equals and we put it in quotes and then we’d have the link there and if you
don’t know HTML do not worry this example is purely just for demonstration
purposes and we’re gonna avoid HTML from this point on but I want to show you
that you can for some of the more advanced users that actually know a
little bit of HTML or you can do some research on it and we’ll close out that
reference there so we have a reference to this link that will be tied to this
now what we’re gonna do is we’re gonna knit this by clicking on that knit</p>
<p>00:02
button now as you can see I have the link as an actual link because it
actually interpreted the HTML pretty cool now every time I run this I can
open it browser which I highly advise you to do
because the this right here is just an browser in our studio rendering of this
as if it wasn’t a browser but you truly should check these out in your own
native browser like this that way there’s no confusion sometimes there
might be an error within our Studios browser rendering versus Chrome or ie
whatever you use let’s close that out so I show you how to do links using HTML
now instead of HTML I have that copied still so if you don’t copy that our
studio site let’s do let’s see if I can remember this it’s been a minute we are
gonna put it in parenthesis and brackets so this bracket I call it a left and
right bracket we’re gonna put in the word link and then right after it you’re</p>
<p>00:03
gonna put it in parenthesis the actual link without quotes this is markdown
language and you can find a lot more about markdown language in various
websites just look up our markdown or markdown language tips notice this is
all I did I’m gonna knit this and we’re going to see the same exact thing pretty
cool so you can you actually embed HTML or you can use the markdown language
which is a little bit cleaner and probably preferred in in this
environment now you see this little star star knit star star the star star means
bold let’s run this again and I’ll show you where the word knit is you’ll notice
it is in fact bold pretty cool simple as that it makes a bold an awesome little
tip if you highlight something like the word document we can double click on it
to highlight it hold shift and hit the star and you’ll notice a star shows up</p>
<p>00:04
on both ends of the document by the way when there’s only one star that is an
italic so let’s knit that and we will see the word document is in fact in
italics you want to make a bowl double click shift star that puts a few
more stars on there and now we have a bold
document I’m not gonna run it right now are you finding these videos useful if
so maybe give it a share in a social media let others know where to find a
good resource for our and our programming that will help me grow my
channel and continue to make more content for you thanks now a couple
other things as you saw the heading up here that’s our markdown what if it was
a little too big or you wanted to make that a third level headed simply just
add a nother star also this space I believe is very important let’s double
check that let’s knit it the way it is it’s kind of fun to create these our
markdowns a little bit smaller than the including plots because the including
plots had two levels or two head or two I believe this is header three and it</p>
<p>00:05
worked now you’re gonna find some frustrations like little simple things
like if I don’t put that space there what will happen
it didn’t do level three and in fact did level basically the paragraph level and
so that can be very frustrating because space doesn’t matter in our markdown so
we need that space after the three hash tags and the same thing for a lot of
other things let me show you another thing that’s very common is adding
bulleted lists we’re gonna hit enter here on line eleven so we’re now on line
twelve I’m going to say this is a list and I’ll put a call there now a new line
I’m gonna hit the star button shift eight two spaces another thing this will
drive you a little bit crazy because you’re going to forget that it’s two
spaces you’re gonna use one you’re gonna have to go google this it’s two spaces</p>
<p>00:06
item one enter star two spaces item to enter star item three so I almost have a
bulleted list but not quite let’s run it the way it is and I’ll show you the
errors because this is also gonna drive you a little bit nuts okay this is a
list and it did not work why did that not work again more space problems it’s
not the space below it is actually but it’s the space between lines twelve and
thirteen the bulleted list has to be on its own
with the space between it even this won’t work correctly I mean it does but
look at item three it adds all the rest to it that’s that’s basically what I was
going to show you and get that so now this with the all that extra space in
there then that is the correct way to do a list now we have a proper list that’s
pretty common so I wanted to make sure to show you all of those things there’s</p>
<p>00:07
all kinds of other things you can do like a horizontal rule which is four
dashes but again it’s the spaces that really get you one two three four
if I literally just run this I don’t believe that it will work there are yeah
well first of all this wrong in multiple ways one I didn’t have the space here
now if I run that it did actually work so spaces matter and some things and
Donal and does no on other things you’ll just have to get used to the fact that
spaces really do cause issues with our markdown again if you want to add
instead of a bulleted list we can do a numbered list by doing one period and
then two spaces adam-12 period two spaces item two sounds sounds
crazy but it’s true that’s what you have to do now we should have one two and
three perfectly lined up you can also do</p>
<p>00:08
things like superscript and subscript so
if I wanted to do superscript I would do X say I want to do x squared so I want
to do an actual x squared like this but I want that to to be actually raised up
you actually have to put a little another exponent I’m not even sure what
that’s called but you can see that the x squared is is actually squared okay
anyways look up and I’ll show you links throughout in some of the documentation
but look up some of the our markdown it’s really interesting and fun to learn
and you can actually use it just for HTML for that matter
if you tried to knit under PDF and you get the error which you will most likely
because you don’t have Mick tech and you’re gonna just have all this red
arrow stuff and then you go to knit again it’s gonna still be under PDF so
you need to go to the down arrow hittin it to HTML again and you’ll see that it
actually knits to HTML pretty cool this is a regular HTML file what you do</p>
<p>00:09
notice though there is some code in here like summary cars but you can’t hide it
you can’t it’s got to be there so there’s another thing called an our notebook
which I will show you in the next tutorial I hope this video was useful
and if it was leave a comment below let me know how and also subscribe that’ll
help me grow my channel and continue creating videos like thisEnd of file</p>
