R-squared explains the degree to which your input variables explain the variation of your predicted variable. The higher the R squared, the more variation is explained by your input variables.

The problem with R-squared is that it will either stay the same or increase with the addition of more variables, even if they do not have any relationship with the output variables. This is where adjusted R squared comes into play. Adjusted R-square penalizes you for adding variables that not improve your existing model.

Typically, the more non-significant variables you add into the model, the gap in R-squared and Adjusted R-squared increases.
