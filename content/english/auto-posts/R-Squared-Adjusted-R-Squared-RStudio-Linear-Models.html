welcome back today we’re gonna talk about when to actually stop adding these
explaining variables the regressors how many variables we
really need are features do we really need to explain what’s going on to
predict the outcome right and of course we’re gonna use my favourite data set
the empty cars data set because it’s very simple and we’ll start off with my
data is equal to empty cars run that you
can see we have our observations and our
variables we have 11 features across the horizontal as you can see here so we
have miles per gallon cylinders etc etc so let’s create our first linear model
we’ll call it model 1 and that will be a
simple one so linear model with our data
equal to my data and we’re gonna explain how do we explain miles per gallon
explained by weight and I just picked that one arbitrarily you could pick</p>
<p>00:01
whatever one you want doesn’t matter so we’ll just run that right now and the
model has been created let’s take a quick look at the summary so summary of
that model one see what when you get out of that and we’ve got all this stuff in
here we talked about the p value this here and we talked about these little
stars and again it doesn’t make sense to much with one predictor the weight
because it’s the only thing that’s explaining the miles per gallon at this
point but if you had multiple predictors in there or aggressors then the star
values might matter the p values might matter but that’s not what we’re looking
at today we’re gonna look at this multiple R squared here
there’s 0.75 to 8 and the adjusted r-squared point seven four four six
don’t worry about memorizing them but just know that it’s kind of kind of
about 0.75 on both of them right in fact we don’t need to display all this other
stuff so let’s go ahead and fix that by doing the dollar sign after this summary
so when the dollar sign is outside of the parentheses it goes with the summary
so it’s like hey what kind of attribute for this summary can we display here and</p>
<p>00:02
we’re gonna display our R dot squared value I believe that’s what it is yeah so
there it is I did that you can see at the bottom here it is 0.75 to 8 and we
can also do the summary one and we can do the adjusted r-squared
so I’ve just add r-squared and there we have it point seven point four is
slightly different so the adjusted r-squared adjusts for how many
parameters or how many explaining variables you have because when you have
multiple explaining variables and I’ll show you this in a second it always gets
a little better and I’ll tell you why that’s kind of not the best way to go so
let’s do a copy and paste of these lines here so ctrl C we’re gonna create
something new control V here and we’ll call this model
2 and over here where the weight is let’s add an explain a variable called</p>
<p>00:03
displacement okay and so let’s change all these to model two as well let’s
take a quick look at what this is all about so number seven run that run that
run that alright so you have point seven eight and point seven six five for the
adjusted so remember the previous one was 0.75 two for the R squared and this
one is 0.78 for the R squared it went up what do you know right in fact let’s go
ahead and copy this again and try another one this time we will paste it
and we’re gonna put it as model 3 and we’ll add just placement plus I don’t
know quarter second value right run that
change these other ones to model 3 don’t forget and run those as well and you’ll
see that it’s now up to 0.8 to in point 807 so it’s always going up and that’s
kind of the lesson I’m trying to tell you is the more you put in there it’s</p>
<p>00:04
always gonna go up so let’s do it I’m doing it again this time we’ll add just
already added displacement will add a cylinders cylinders
I’ll make this model for I hope you can tell that I just copied and pasted it so
four and four and let’s try this again fifteen sixteen and seventeen point
eight two it went up a loop point eight four for my R squared and my R squared
before that was 0.82 you can see that it’s still jumping up and up and up what
else do we have left we’re running out of
features here oh we have vs we have drat let’s try we have cylinders carb I let
strike let’s try carb so one more and then I
will move on to something else here so we’re gonna add carb make this model 5 +
5 + 5 boom boom boom point eight four four so we add point</p>
<p>00:05
eight four three here and then I’m up to point eight four four try to tell
because I’m doing both the R squared and the adjusted R squared so let’s just
copy one of these R Squared’s and take a quick look at it all together down here
control V let’s put that in five times and we will change it to one two three
four five and we’ll see them right after one two three four five so let’s run
this boom boom boom boom boom here we go alright so we have point eight four no
that’s not where started so we have point eight one five nope uh what did I
do wrong here there we go okay screwed up let’s clear this by this little
paintbrush here boom let’s just run these so we don’t get mixed up and there
we have it point seven five point seven eight point eight two point eight four
three point eight four four okay now here’s where the lesson might be for you
we added these various features as we created these models and as you can see</p>
<p>00:06
the jump from model for to model five was just very minut it went from point
eight four three nine twenty eight four four you know that jump wasn’t very big
so we’re gonna add a lot of complexity to our model by saying hey let’s add
this card here right but in reality it’s not really doing us any good because it
didn’t get us much better model every time you add a feature to this model
your r-squared will go up in value right
so no matter what you do what’s going up it’s gonna fit the training data better
and that’s the key here if it fits the training data that’s fine and dandy you
can actually with computers you can fit the training data eggs
exactly I can find an equation with this computer exactly that’ll fit every
single point on this chart if I wanted to write but we don’t want to do that
because we’re gonna overfit the data because we know that that’s not reality
the next vehicle is gonna have different statistics and it’s not gonna line up</p>
<p>00:07
there’s no point in making it exact we’re not trying to figure out what we
already know we know the data here right so if I find an exact equation that’ll
give me every single number every time of these variables fine and dandy but I
already have the data I have a table of data here I can give you the exact
answer I don’t need a formula I just need hey give me the weight give
me the miles per gallon and I could tell you anything about it right so we don’t
need that we just need something close so our models getting too complex for
very little gain that’s all I’m trying to say there let’s go ahead and try this
again one more time but this time we’re gonna use the adjusted r-squared so
paste that and I’ll just type in adj for each one sure just yeah there we go
and let’s just kind of compare these while we’re at it I’m gonna clear this
with that little paintbrush and rerun these and I’ll see what we have so what
you see here now is that they’re not always going up so the adjusted r-squared</p>
<p>00:08
it takes into account how significant each one of these features truly are now
the math behind that is too complex for this tutorial right now but just know
that the adjusted r-squared is usually a
better indicator for whether or not this model is you know getting better enough
so let’s take a look here the first one was point seven four four then it went
to point seven six then I went to point eight point eight
two then it jumped back down to point eight one right so you know we can
actually say that possibly without the carb we’re doing a better better job
fit in this data to this model right so we fit the data to the model we want to
be able to predict what’s next that’s a goal so knowing that think about this
other situation that we’re in now we have weight displacement quarter second
cylinder right and we decided if we add carb we’re over we’re over doing it
where our adjusted r-square is going down our model is not really getting any
better so let’s just take this model for for</p>
<p>00:09
example and we have weight displacement Q second cylinder but we didn’t use some
other features that are in the in the data we didn’t use a.m. or gear or
horsepower we didn’t use those so how do
we know if we’ve got the best model well we can try every combination of all
features with a variant amount of features inside of the model we try
every combination of two every combination of three every combination
of four and so on and so on and test all these out now that’s pretty cumbersome
so in the future tutorials we’ll show you how to actually test this without
doing a whole lot of this repeatability that’s it for this lesson if you found
these useful again please share like post them all over the place for me
that’ll help my channel out help me grow and continue to do these and hope you
guys come back for the next one thanks you [Music]End of file</p>
