welcome back to the channel today I’m gonna talk to you a little bit more
about what I’ve been doing rather than showing you more are and I think you’ll
find this interesting especially if you’ve watched the six tutorials on how
to create a blog down Hugo website now I’m not gonna walk you through this
entire process that I’m doing right now but I am gonna show you that I do have
it on github and you can go ahead and pull it and play with it if you want the
goal for me was to take all of my videos now I have multiple channels so I might
have four or five hundred videos total that’s a lot but on my art channel I
might have maybe 60 or 70 right so what I want to do my intention is to create a
automated flow where it takes all those YouTube videos downloads them all to my
hard drive the metadata the thumbnails the closed captions that are
auto-generated if I can get all that data I can create a blog post
automatically and I’ve I’m getting pretty successful at that right now
last two days I’ve been playing with it probably I put in a lot of hours maybe</p>
<p>00:01
10 hours in two days maybe three days or something like that but um so what I
have now is right now what you see is this program called YouTube - DL that’s
downloading all of my content I had to figure out configuration files for that
to get it to download there correct things in the right order without
break-in etc etc I have all that it’s all in my github and I walk you through
it but I’m not gonna walk you through it in this tutorial so in the next couple
tutorials if you’re used if you’re interested in creating dynamic web pages
based in our studio then you know stay tuned for awhile
basically what I do though is I have two different files right so that’s
downloading and it’s gonna create all the stuff and all these folders
everywhere and what I do is I have two different files I have one here that
what I use it for is to convert okay what do I need let’s move them to my
project file based on the YouTube download stuff let’s convert things from
like one format to another let’s strip spaces etc etc I do all that I do
something like pre-processing with that it’s not a lot of code but I’ll walk you</p>
<p>00:02
through that later in more detail and then I have another file here now this
one actually creates our MD files for me now if you see down here on my
right-hand side the bottom right all of these are MD files every single one of
them and the HTML that comes with it because
it’s been rendered but think about the RMD I only have a few here because I
didn’t download all of them yet but all of these every single RMD file I did not
create I did not create a single one of them let me click on one now show you
what I’m talking about so that script that you just saw this
one YouTube the RMD that I created I’m gonna show you how to do that one in the
next tutorial and in a very basic way I’m gonna say hey let’s use a script and
create an army file and this is all it creates right it puts the yamo code
which is up top the Yambol that I chose and picked and I self to fix the tags I
didn’t do the tags yet but the categories I’ve got ooh I could do
multiple categories anyways of course I can but my categories are gonna
basically be like in my blog you’d be able to you’ll be able to select it just</p>
<p>00:03
like you’d click a playlist on the YouTube I’ve got some embedded links
here which will take you to the YouTube I know you can’t see the site from this
I’ve got a lot of blank space I need to get rid of but then I have all of my
narrative this is the YouTube closed captions that they gave me so that’s a
good head start like hey I can like turn this into an actual like grammatically
correct blog post pretty easy now that I have all this ready to go now this was
created for every single video that I had that I downloaded if I click on
another one I can delete these right now rerender it it’s back back in no time
right so I have all these RMD files and now what happens with your empty files
if they’re in your post directory of a blog down Hugo site when you render or
serve your site it renders all of those posts those are MD files that I didn’t
create and creates actual HTML like it embeds the HTML creates the files and
you have a site so this is an automated way to make a website let me give you a
quick show of my site of course it all gets pushed to github which goes to net</p>
<p>00:04
low fee and then it’s Auto deployed alright so let’s see I’m gonna pull a
tab over and I’ll just show you what I have up there today now this is still
just I’m just playing with it I’ve got a lot more work to do but look I’ve got
thumbnails I’ve got this nice elegant way to look at it and it works
mobile-friendly as well and I like the mobile-friendly version as well but I
can click on any one of these let’s say the first one and I’ve got my thumbnail
here I’ve got my our blog down site like category you can
have multiple categories by the way you can I just haven’t done that yet but
then it’s got all my narrative right and I didn’t write that narrative YouTube
did so it’s like how can we automate the heck out of this and then if I click on
this it’ll go to my YouTube video so I might even make it so it’s an external
click I’m not sure but there it is right so if I click on categories you can see
all the categories I have I’m trying to I’m gonna try to match those to my
playlist automatically so that my playlists are like hey it’s not a
category it’s a playlist but it’s on my website and then tags I haven’t done yet</p>
<p>00:05
but tags will be something similar it’ll be whatever tags I have in YouTube on
those particular videos I’m gonna import them in and then eventually of course I
will I will update the blogs to be legit blogs but I think this is gonna help
with SEO traffic like hey you’ve got a lot of content on there brings somebody
to my site and then of course I can add a discuss panel where you can comment on
it I can what I what I really want to do is make sure the code is there for you
so right now I haven’t really been given
people code because I just didn’t really have a good convenient way to do that
but now I do I’m gonna start creating an arm D file with the code which is funny
I actually had a description in my youtube video that had like exact code
you need in the arm D file but because I was pulling the description and putting
it into my arm D file I was my arm D file was writing was rendering code that
came from YouTube so was render in that code which caused an error because it
was actually dealing with like local hard drive stuff which you don’t want to</p>
<p>00:06
not really with an arm D file that you hand off to somebody because you can’t
store and save things through most browsers anyways so this is it it’s very
nice it’s a good start and like I said it’s all coming from the hugo blog down
net leafy and github all of this came from that so i will walk you through
bits and pieces of this throughout some tutorials and i hope that they’re useful
for everybody that being said let’s let’s call it a day and I will leave the
link to the github at the bottom so you can at least clone it and mess with it
if you choose to you’re gonna need a lot of help probably with the YouTube - DL
hopefully I’ll have a post for that as well
I do want to keep this are specific but I do think that since I’m using R this
is relevant to the channel so if you guys like this type of information and
you want to do this please subscribe and follow and share and like and all of
that good stuffEnd of file</p>
