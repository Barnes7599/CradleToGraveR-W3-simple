hey welcome back to the channel today I'm gonna teach you how to create
dynamic RMD files and so dynamic RMD files will help us in a few ways one way
is I'm gonna automate the shell of how my blogs are going to look with the tags
and the categories everything that you want in there
I'm you could put whatever Yam will code
you want in there any type of headers or
make it a template it doesn't matter but the point is if you have external
documents that you want to convert to our MD files this particular tutorial
might help you in that case so I created a blank project so I just did file new
project empty directory set it up and just to be a little bit more realistic
let's create a let's set this up as a hugo site you don't have to do this you
can create any project you want and do this but I'm I'm gonna do it with the
hugo site just because to kind of give it a real aspect to it so i have red up
here is the hugo themes i'm gonna select this theme right here go to the home
page or the download page which should get you to a github site i'm gonna copy

00:01
this author and a repository name of this Hugo site so again if you haven't
caught up with the Hugo playlist that I have start with start start with the
first tutorial and you'll probably get a
better understanding of what we're doing here but anyways we're gonna create a
site that looks kind of like this we're just gonna copy this and we're gonna go
back to our studio somewhere here our studio and I'm not gonna paste it yet
I'll paste it just just one moment so I'm gonna use this particular method for
creating the blog down site hugo site because i've run into problems with the
other methods mostly due to the config tamil file being in different places
with these new projects so for some reason it works best if i use this right
here so blog down calling : new site and then in the theme we're gonna say

00:02
basically set equal to what we just copied i'm gonna erase all those spaces
though and then let's put in some other parameters here and i've got a little
cheat sheet that i'm using me to hit enter parameters sample equals true and
then d directories equals true and then finally to - yeah mall equals true let's
see if that works error up theme you know I've done this multiple times where
the biggest mistake I make is I don't spell things correctly so theme and hit
enter on that so it's downloading the theme it's doing this thing they should
probably render and show here we go so we have this already set up we have an
IP address we can copy this and don't forget this is not the point of this
tutorial but I'm just still kind of setting you up for what we're doing so
here's our here's our nice little blog setup here actually I kind of like it
mm-hmm that's interest enough so click on one

00:03
and you can get to the actual blog site go back that's what we have right but I
want to create another post on this so let's do that but I'm gonna do it
dynamically so first I'm going to create an R script so file new file R script
make sure everything's good so we have an R script and what's this our script
gonna do it's basically just gonna create our post so remember if you go to
files and you go to content posts this is these are where the posts are that
you just saw so if I go back to here you know all these posts markdown syntax if
I click on it you'd get to markdown - syntax right up here but anyways that
should be right here so this RMD file let's take a quick look at it we want it
to look something like this let's say we wanted to just create a
basic template what did I do oh okay so here's the syntax right here
what does this one up close that don't need it alright so we basically need to

00:04
replicate this so there's a couple of ways to do this and I think we're going
to start off with this method it's gonna
be pretty for pretty laid-back way to do it probably not the best way but I want
to show you how to do this right now so I'm gonna just paste that here in my R
syntax just as a reference I'm gonna I'm
gonna ctrl shift C to comment it all out
because remember this is an R script not an RMD file I'm going to create an RMD
file so let's see so basically what we want to do I'm
gonna I'm gonna bring in a library called here just to help me with paths
you know like if I just type in down here now I can use here and it tells me
what my current path is and it's gonna set like the here function is always
going to be this path the dynamic RMD files so I'm I can always start right
here and I know that I want to write something to the posts right so content
posts and here it is and I'll show you how to easily get to that with here

00:05
function you just do here and then a quote you say content because remember
it starts at the RMD file dynamic CarMD files content posts and I think that was
it hit enter and and it brings you there so that's that's a little shortcut for
us alright so what we want to do we want to create some sort of yeah mol string
and that string is going to contain all the stuff that we need which is this
right here so let's just kind of put that in there now don't forget we can
we're gonna make things dynamic here in a moment so let me give you the basic
basic version as if we're just gonna copy this exactly in fact that date has
to be over because the ML code is very specific with whitespace like very
specific don't have a space after any of these like it's it's very specific so
let's just create something just to see that it works dot dot dot or dash dash
dash right and then why well we want to put a return character right because if
you look at number one here this row it's got the three dashes and then a

00:06
return ignore the comments of course one
way to do that let's just put everything
into a paste so paste and what I'm gonna do is I would say my separator after
each one of these little quotes is going
to be equal to a new line so that's what that equals so if I do that we can set
that UML to equal that so if I come down here I can just say what is my mo type
it in hit enter and you see the dashes and no new line yet but now let's
pretend okay when I hit enter here we're gonna add more to this so I'm gonna do
comma and I'm just gonna type in the word date colon a space quote comma so
now if I do control a on line 14 or control-enter we get an error what's my air
[Music] paste comma I've got two commas in a row there it is
alright let's try it again there we go so yeah Moe YAML and I'm just showing

00:07
you kind of like what's going on here the backslash n did not work that's
interesting in itself oh oh oh I am so sorry so what you want to do is you want
to cat this out even though it doesn't show it it's showing you like the the
actual string that it is and it is that string backslash end date but if we do
cat and we type in yeah mo that's where we see what it would look like to the
end user to the very end where we're gonna put this now you see that it
worked with the the actual backslash n so that's very confusing when you use
them paste it's going to give you the literal string just as it you type it
out which is what we want because when it finally does its thing to the next
pipe you know pipeline activity it'll actually be what I just showed you here
with the actual enter so now we want description well we could put in a date
let's you know what let's let's automate putting in a date so let's just say

00:08
today's date I don't know is there a system file for that system date system
date so let's just say today is equal to system date hit enter now we have some
sort of date there now if we do if we put in the word date here right and then
comma because we can continue to add to this paste remember that this backslash
n is gonna apply to every single aspect of this right so this is not gonna work
so if I if I do gamble now if I hit enter on that oh I also say to the date
type that and error error error error date date to date cannot coerce type
closure to vector of type character what does that even mean let's do this let's
do as dot character for system date and see if that works cuz I'm not sure it
looks like the same error I didn't come into this prepared

00:09
accommodate what's wrong with my date or today I'm an idiot
it's today so let's try that let's get rid of this ass character and there we
go let's try it one more time there we go back I'm just showing you again this
is not gonna work so yeah mo again if we just type that in it's not gonna look
correct let's do cat and then we're gonna
basically see what it looks like to the end user and you see that date and the
actual date are on two different lines we don't want that so what we're gonna
do is within soon with inside of this paste we're gonna do another paste but
we'll call this one paste is zero so we want date so we're gonna do paste zero
open parenthesis and then I'll add in the date to that and in close
parentheses comma so this entire line 17 is acting as if it's one entity so its
first gonna execute date and today and that zero means there is no separator
whatsoever there's no backslash and there's no space there's nothing so just
concatenate that's all it's doing it's concatenate in that lab for us and

00:10
that's it so now if I do command enter on that yeah mo and we do cat yeah well
what you should get the three dashes the date and then that's it but we have to
continue you know we have more than date let's add I'm not gonna do the whole
thing I'm just gonna show you a couple more let's do description and you can
imagine that's in quotes by the way so let's do quote description colon space
don't get space comma now again if you're gonna add the description without
a separator like the backslash n let's just do another pace zero so paste 0 we
want description and what we're gonna have is this is my script that's my mo
code and then close parentheses that face 0 comma and then let's just close
this out we're gonna say dash dash dash comma right so now yeah mo boom that
worked no errors sorry about the other errors cat yeah mo we have a full yeah

00:11
mo sort of you know you can add to this and imagine just like I used the
variable for the date which was today your description could be coming from
another file could be coming from somewhere
could be dynamically created so that's the whole point I'm trying to
dynamically create Yemma files now the next thing we want to do is write this
to a file basically so let's just do that and we'll go from there
so back back over here alright so what we want to do is just basically do a
write right to file function which is just plain right WRI T and what do I
want to write I want to write that Y mo where do I want to so that's the the
string I'm bringing in is y mo what we're just defined and what's our file
equal to basically we want to file to equal somewhere in the post right so let
me just check I don't think you can have spaces or anything in there so we're

00:12
gonna do file equals and I'm going to say paste 0 again I love the space 0 and
paste I'm gonna say here remember we have that here function that I showed
you here we want to under content comma pose was it plural or not let's just
find out content post singular and lower
case okay that's where I want it but I'm
also gonna paste in the actual file name
so you can make that dynamic as well but we're gonna call this file name let me
say forward slash test dot R MD and then
I'll also do in a pend equals false so I want to bring it's gonna overwrite it
every time and let's just see if this works I think that should do the trick
I'm gonna do command enter on that rendering I wrote it the fact that it
rendered a is good because I didn't tell it to but because we're in a Hugo
project right now blog down Hugo Project

00:13
it automatically rendered it so let's go
to that arm D file test arm D boom right here
and there we go this is this is Midas script it created this camel file now
you can create a new one every single day with because it has today in here so
if you run the script every day it'll be a new day a new
a new file I guess it'll just make a little bit more sense if now don't get
me wrong as this gets more complicated you might want to separate out and have
more variables but after the - - - we can add more content we can say I'm
gonna do another backslash and an extra one so a separator plus another
backslash in just to give it some space and then I'll say I'm gonna say hashtag
head in one so I'm gonna set this template up that's what I want
comma oops I didn't want to save that but you could save this document of course
so let's rerun the ammo boom rerun the right and it's gonna overwrite something

00:14
failed I think a non-empty title element
let's see what it looks like so test out our MD what did I do wrong oh there is
no title element so apparently you need to have a title in this ya mole for this
Hugo blog down to work which makes sense because that's how it works so but you
can see that the head and one is there let's just add that title because it
said so and for fun in fact let me show you another thing you can add the title
up here of course you can do title equals in quotes right we could do that
but and you should because this is your script for doing this you can go
actually to this markdown syntax right here in the test and you can actually
add it and you'll say title now this will be overwritten though so if you
don't do it in your script it's going to be a written test title and when you
save this which it should already be saved because you wrote it to file
already that's why it's over here on the bottom right now when I go to test out

00:15
our MD which is this that's fine I don't know if it rewrote this test out HTML
but remember we're serving this site right now if I could find it right here
let's see if we go back to site test title is right here it showed up click
on it and here's our heading right now it doesn't mean March but that's what I
wanted to show you was how you can dynamically create these yellow files
and now remember if this test our MD you can delete it I can just completely
delete it let's let's go ahead and do that I don't need this one so test out
our MD delete test our HTML to click on delete yes gone right oh good
thing I have this script that creates automatic Rd files for me so let's just
rerun the script boom all of a sudden my test out RMB is there and my test out
HTML which is what Hugo is gonna use to build the website so that's all there is
to it I really hope that this was helpful a little long-winded but I think
the process you learned a little bit about paste and paste zero how yellow

00:16
files work a little bit better how to dynamically create Rd files I imagine
most of those strings are variables that you've gathered from somewhere else the
report the actual data that you're using instead of you know something else so I
appreciate you guys listening to these videos and like and share and subscribe
