welcome back to cradle-to-grave our my name is Mark and I'm gonna show you
today in this series actually I'm going to show you how to create websites use
an R and a theme called Hugo which is written in the NGO language and how to
actually publish these to the websites right for free all of it completely free
the only thing that would cost money is if you wanted your own specific domain
name like cradle-to-grave are calm that would cost you like 12
bucks a year other than that we're gonna create a dynamic static site now I say
that because it's static but it's dynamic because you can update it with
our click a couple buttons and the site has been updated you can also add in
third-party add-ons that'll add like a discuss channel or discuss add-on to
your blogs where people can actually comment so it's a static site
technically but it's gonna be very dynamic in nature so stay tuned what

00:01
what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna take my current our site down completely
from the WordPress site that I have which is I don't I don't want to pay the
money for it anymore and I'm gonna create that site using our
and I'll show you how to do that in this little miniseries I'm gonna put
together we're gonna create some actual websites using our to publish them and
do every all the work we're not going to really just use our though we're gonna
we're going to download a couple of packages we're going to use Hugo as a
theme generator and we're gonna create a static website that's not really static
it's just technically it's static but it's actually dynamic you're gonna
create blogs you're going to be able to update them you're going to be able to
publish them for free using either get labs github or net Liffey and you can
also have your own unique domain name now that part cost so if you own the

00:02
domain name for you know twelve bucks a year you can definitely tie it to net
low fee and get labs if you don't own your own domain name you can still do
this so follow along it's a completely free everything about this is free
except for if you own your own domain name so if you get stuck at any time and
I'm confusing you there's a website called blog down org where I've learned
most of these instructions so I'm just putting it in video format and I'm gonna
add to it as we go but what you want to do is you want to install a package
called blog down first I'm not going to click install because
I've already installed it but when you do that it should take maybe a couple of
minutes depending on your internet connection it's gonna install all the
dependencies everything it needs to get blogged down started now once you do
that there's also another set of tools you'd want to download called dev tools
now if you go to install again if I'm if you're still installing blog down I
recommend pause in this video so that blog down can finish installing so it's

00:03
called dev tools and you can download that just by doing the same thing go to
the package manager packages install and type in dev tools install now the next
thing you want to do after that works you want to use the blog down you just
type in blog down colon colon so that's the name space the scope of this
function I'm gonna use a function called install Hugo as you can see below so it
says install Hugo I've already done that as well that's about as far as I
gotta know so the rest is just basically
new for me so once you do that I'm gonna actually run that and see what it says
so it's gonna install Hugo which is a theme
Hugo is a theme for websites built using the go language you don't have to know
any of that right now you don't have to know anything about HTML nothing you
just literally install it and it does its thing so it's installed Hugo has been
installed that was that that was very simple
luckily blogged down made it easy to install Hugo that's basically what's

00:04
going on here now the best way to learn anything is to actually create the
example right so within just minutes we're gonna create the example file new
project I don't care about saving this one I want to go to a new directory and
I call it a new project you could do now that I have blogged down I could say
website using blog down but let's just go with new project so we could start
from scratch and say hey no we're not gonna do that I'm going to create a in
my documents I will create a new folder called site tests whatever you want to
call it that's where I'm gonna place this new site and this will be my first
our site with Hugo whatever you want to call it anyways
let's create the project and you'll see it's just a blank project like like all
of your projects are when you first start just like this so the next thing
you want to do and this is so simple is you just type in new underscore I'm

00:05
sorry blog down blog down new underscore site boom and now it's gonna generate
everything I need to create a website through our you can see my computer's
pretty fast but you see over here in the viewer I already have a website in fact
I could pop this out I think somehow maybe pop it out boom oh wow when I pop
it out it actually goes to it actually goes to my browser that is default so
that's cool so I'll just keep this up here in this area and show you that look
here these are two blogs this is a link li I'm not sure what that is about page
if I click on it you get to it and you can hit back I can actually check out my
log post with code this is pretty interesting so you're already there
you've already created a website now Grenda this is locally hosted on your
computer I'm gonna X that out you can also do those things within the viewer

00:06
here as you can see I will actually change me to be a little bit higher I
suppose in fact I wanted me to be this big I think very small I want me to just
be a talking head so we've got that talking head going now this works I mean
within here I can click on about I can click on github and then github is
actually a link so it actually will pull up your your link and Twitter and all
that stuff there's many things you can do so this is really cool stuff to do
with our and eventually I'm going to show you guys how to use git labs and
actually publish straight from our so you're gonna be doing code in fact I
didn't even I didn't I've used this a long time ago but without reading the
instructions I'm gonna show you what this file is I'm gonna give you what's
going on here so first let's go to the files here so let's start let's start up
there in this file setup here it's going to be in that directory that I had so
when I go to my file explorer I can go to file explorer here bring it on over

00:07
and go to documents and I called that site test my first are with Hugo and now
you see all of these different files I'm not gonna play with it here within the
Explorer because it's already down here in my our Studio IDE so under files if
you click on the files tab you'll see the same thing a couple of things to
know you want a config file which is called config dot T om l and t om l is
like you know you've probably heard of ya mol yet another markdown language
it's just another markdown language to have the interpreters interpret these
things as as as they should be right I have an indexed at RM d and if you look
at the title of this actual tab here it's it's actually like a post it's a
hello our markdown right and if we go back to the viewer
just click on that if I go back to the main site right here a plain markdown

00:08
pose 2016 hello are marked down so that this right here is this post so when I
click on it you can read this post and it's just an RMD file and I know I've
showed you guys some RMD file some markdown files so let's take a look at
it the only thing that's slightly different actually not even because
you've seen this ya mole code before 1 through 7 if you follow the rest of the
tutorials I believe that's just animal code it's it's got a title hello our
markdown that's a title of my blog who's the author what's the date categories
you can configure a lot of this stuff elsewhere but we'll get into that in
future tutorials now we have a code chunk what is this code chunk well it's
our because it's backtick backtick backtick r and then it's got a few
parameter set and then line 10 is just saying hey you know we're going to knit
this using these parameters as well and knitting really this is a default adhere
I didn't you'll probably never change this most likely but now pound our

00:09
markdown we saw the that hash tag here that pound what I'm gonna call it it's
got the single header you can read that here you see the our markdown how it's
bigger well it's because it's a header it's got that pound if I change this to
double pound and then I run it know how do I knit I can check that or I could
serve the site we'll get into that later so let's let's forget about changing it
for now but there's way so there's a couple of things I'm gonna show you in
future tutorials when you update I can make it so that you can update this and
you'll have a browser open and as you update it changes it on the browser so
you truly get to know what it looks like in real time right we haven't got that
far yet so I'm gonna keep this all the same for now I'm just describing the
bits and pieces now this is an hour markdown document look at it down here
in the actual thing this is an arm work down document it's nice right and you
even have a link you could see that the link has the brackets and that's just
basically the our markdown syntax so we know it's kind of highlighted there but

00:10
we know that that's a hyperlink because it's got the bracket notation here
anyways you also have the cars data set so not empty cars but just cars my
favorite is empty cars I guess but anyways they didn't they're just calling
us cars so you can name your chunks we haven't talked about that too much but
every chunk can have a name so you can use the name to advantage for different
things you can call chunks from other parts of the code you can recall a chunk
kind of like a function but we didn't get into that either but anyways in this
code we have the summary of cars we have a model oh we've already talked about
linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we
modeling here let's just go and do a little a little backtracking here we
have a linear model we're gonna say hey I want to know if distance can be
explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the
chunk called pi they have a figure caption which is automatically
captioning things and then Tidy equals falls I don't remember what that e what
that means but that's all it is but that's it that's it right there now
let's let's go back to our files here I already gave up on the instructions so I
apologize but I want to kind of give you an idea of what's going on with all
these files because you've created a lot
of files with this one project and so we have the config dot Tamil I believe I

00:12
can edit that here yeah here we go so right here I just clicked on config dot
Tomo T om l and you have all kinds of configuration settings and you can add
more and change things and we're gonna be going into these to make those
changes like these Twitter sites github sites you've change them to your own
then you can add all kinds of different parameters to help help you out logo dot
PNG where is that located we can go find that out as well
so let's get out of the config dot Tomo and I'm going to show you more about
this file structure here so we also have what we have content and we have public
those are the two I want you to focus on
the content is actually where you create the content right if I have a post so
this blog post right here 2015 oh seven twenty three our markdown ARMD you know
that file name is under content let's actually check that out because that's
actually pretty important so let's go to this is not it but documents I think I

00:13
did yeah well site test okay my first our site with you go don't click on that
and I said contents important let's double click on content what do we have
I have about MD but that's not a post you saw the about page but then I have
this post folder so let's go to post now these it's confusing because this isn't
really a post on your website this is a post that we could put on our website
and when we choose to render this and push it to the get lab or the net lift
fee right all these free services that will host websites for free then it'll
be a real post but these are like basically pending posts and what do we
have here we have MD file so a markdown file we have an RMD file and let's
scroll down here we have 2015 oh seven 23 2015 7 23 are marked down to our MD
so the RMD file is what we're dealing with which is located here that's truly
where this file is located it under the our environment that's very important

00:14
now because it's confusing let's go back
to the beginning here and let's click on
public now in public these are different are well not are you should never have
to interact with public don't mess with public until you really know what you're
doing because the are when you render this finally when you generate the site
are will push all of that information to this public folder so when you're all
said and done the only thing that your host needs to see
is the public folder so don't get confused so we had post we have a folder
called post here right and we have this 2015 oh seven twenty-three we have
figures we have all these things we didn't do any of that we didn't do any
of that don't post in public for now do not mess with public just mess with
content the content is what you're messing with so if you if you made a

00:15
mistake you don't want that blog you can delete the RMD file regenerate
everything and then your public folder because you regenerated it the public
folder will be updated so let's say you deleted 25 different posts from your
content folder and you didn't update your site they'll still be there and
it'll confuse you so once you update and generate the site
again it takes care of that you can delete your public folder and regenerate
it all day long as long as you have everything you need in the content
that's all I'm trying to say that's very confusing but I think that's enough to
get started today it doesn't seem like much but it's actually doing a
tremendous amount of things in the background that's gonna help us out I'm
gonna show you to publish these it's gonna be it's gonna be a pretty fun fun
little tutorial so if you want to follow along some more please do and subscribe
like et cetera and comment below if you have any issues I'll try to answer them

00:16
comment below if you have already created one or want to just say hi so I
will see you guys in the next one you [Music]End of file

code we have the summary of cars we have a model oh we've already talked about
linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we
modeling here let's just go and do a little a little backtracking here we
have a linear model we're gonna say hey I want to know if distance can be
explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the
chunk called pi they have a figure caption which is automatically
captioning things and then Tidy equals falls I don't remember what that e what
that means but that's all it is but that's it that's it right there now
let's let's go back to our files here I already gave up on the instructions so I
apologize but I want to kind of give you an idea of what's going on with all
these files because you've created a lot
of files with this one project and so we have the config dot Tamil I believe I

00:12
can edit that here yeah here we go so right here I just clicked on config dot

figures we have all these things we didn't do any of that we didn't do any
of that don't post in public for now do not mess with public just mess with
content the content is what you're messing with so if you if you made a

00:15
mistake you don't want that blog you can delete the RMD file regenerate
everything and then your public folder because you regenerated it the public
folder will be updated so let's say you deleted 25 different posts from your
content folder and you didn't update your site they'll still be there and
it'll confuse you so once you update and generate the site
again it takes care of that you can delete your public folder and regenerate
it all day long as long as you have everything you need in the content
that's all I'm trying to say that's very confusing but I think that's enough to
get started today it doesn't seem like much but it's actually doing a
tremendous amount of things in the background that's gonna help us out I'm
gonna show you to publish these it's gonna be it's gonna be a pretty fun fun
little tutorial so if you want to follow along some more please do and subscribe
like et cetera and comment below if you have any issues I'll try to answer them

00:16
comment below if you have already created one or want to just say hi so I
will see you guys in the next one you [Music]End of file

00:00
welcome back to cradle-to-grave our my name is Mark and I'm gonna show you
today in this series actually I'm going to show you how to create websites use
an R and a theme called Hugo which is written in the NGO language and how to
actually publish these to the websites right for free all of it completely free
the only thing that would cost money is if you wanted your own specific domain
name like cradle-to-grave are calm that would cost you like 12
bucks a year other than that we're gonna create a dynamic static site now I say
that because it's static but it's dynamic because you can update it with
our click a couple buttons and the site has been updated you can also add in
third-party add-ons that'll add like a discuss channel or discuss add-on to
your blogs where people can actually comment so it's a static site
technically but it's gonna be very dynamic in nature so stay tuned what

00:01
what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna take my current our site down completely
from the WordPress site that I have which is I don't I don't want to pay the
money for it anymore and I'm gonna create that site using our
and I'll show you how to do that in this little miniseries I'm gonna put
together we're gonna create some actual websites using our to publish them and
do every all the work we're not going to really just use our though we're gonna
we're going to download a couple of packages we're going to use Hugo as a
theme generator and we're gonna create a static website that's not really static
it's just technically it's static but it's actually dynamic you're gonna
create blogs you're going to be able to update them you're going to be able to
publish them for free using either get labs github or net Liffey and you can
also have your own unique domain name now that part cost so if you own the

00:02
domain name for you know twelve bucks a year you can definitely tie it to net
low fee and get labs if you don't own your own domain name you can still do
this so follow along it's a completely free everything about this is free
except for if you own your own domain name so if you get stuck at any time and
I'm confusing you there's a website called blog down org where I've learned
most of these instructions so I'm just putting it in video format and I'm gonna
add to it as we go but what you want to do is you want to install a package
called blog down first I'm not going to click install because
I've already installed it but when you do that it should take maybe a couple of
minutes depending on your internet connection it's gonna install all the
dependencies everything it needs to get blogged down started now once you do
that there's also another set of tools you'd want to download called dev tools
now if you go to install again if I'm if you're still installing blog down I
recommend pause in this video so that blog down can finish installing so it's

00:03
called dev tools and you can download that just by doing the same thing go to
the package manager packages install and type in dev tools install now the next
thing you want to do after that works you want to use the blog down you just
type in blog down colon colon so that's the name space the scope of this
function I'm gonna use a function called install Hugo as you can see below so it
says install Hugo I've already done that as well that's about as far as I
gotta know so the rest is just basically
new for me so once you do that I'm gonna actually run that and see what it says
so it's gonna install Hugo which is a theme
Hugo is a theme for websites built using the go language you don't have to know
any of that right now you don't have to know anything about HTML nothing you
just literally install it and it does its thing so it's installed Hugo has been
installed that was that that was very simple
luckily blogged down made it easy to install Hugo that's basically what's

00:04
going on here now the best way to learn anything is to actually create the
example right so within just minutes we're gonna create the example file new
project I don't care about saving this one I want to go to a new directory and
I call it a new project you could do now that I have blogged down I could say
website using blog down but let's just go with new project so we could start
from scratch and say hey no we're not gonna do that I'm going to create a in
my documents I will create a new folder called site tests whatever you want to
call it that's where I'm gonna place this new site and this will be my first
our site with Hugo whatever you want to call it anyways
let's create the project and you'll see it's just a blank project like like all
of your projects are when you first start just like this so the next thing
you want to do and this is so simple is you just type in new underscore I'm

00:05
sorry blog down blog down new underscore site boom and now it's gonna generate
everything I need to create a website through our you can see my computer's
pretty fast but you see over here in the viewer I already have a website in fact
I could pop this out I think somehow maybe pop it out boom oh wow when I pop
it out it actually goes to it actually goes to my browser that is default so
that's cool so I'll just keep this up here in this area and show you that look
here these are two blogs this is a link li I'm not sure what that is about page
if I click on it you get to it and you can hit back I can actually check out my
log post with code this is pretty interesting so you're already there
you've already created a website now Grenda this is locally hosted on your
computer I'm gonna X that out you can also do those things within the viewer

00:06
here as you can see I will actually change me to be a little bit higher I
suppose in fact I wanted me to be this big I think very small I want me to just
be a talking head so we've got that talking head going now this works I mean
within here I can click on about I can click on github and then github is
actually a link so it actually will pull up your your link and Twitter and all
that stuff there's many things you can do so this is really cool stuff to do
with our and eventually I'm going to show you guys how to use git labs and
actually publish straight from our so you're gonna be doing code in fact I
didn't even I didn't I've used this a long time ago but without reading the
instructions I'm gonna show you what this file is I'm gonna give you what's
going on here so first let's go to the files here so let's start let's start up
there in this file setup here it's going to be in that directory that I had so
when I go to my file explorer I can go to file explorer here bring it on over

00:07
and go to documents and I called that site test my first are with Hugo and now
you see all of these different files I'm not gonna play with it here within the
Explorer because it's already down here in my our Studio IDE so under files if
you click on the files tab you'll see the same thing a couple of things to
know you want a config file which is called config dot T om l and t om l is
like you know you've probably heard of ya mol yet another markdown language
it's just another markdown language to have the interpreters interpret these
things as as as they should be right I have an indexed at RM d and if you look
at the title of this actual tab here it's it's actually like a post it's a
hello our markdown right and if we go back to the viewer
just click on that if I go back to the main site right here a plain markdown

00:08
pose 2016 hello are marked down so that this right here is this post so when I
click on it you can read this post and it's just an RMD file and I know I've
showed you guys some RMD file some markdown files so let's take a look at
it the only thing that's slightly different actually not even because
you've seen this ya mole code before 1 through 7 if you follow the rest of the
tutorials I believe that's just animal code it's it's got a title hello our
markdown that's a title of my blog who's the author what's the date categories
you can configure a lot of this stuff elsewhere but we'll get into that in
future tutorials now we have a code chunk what is this code chunk well it's
our because it's backtick backtick backtick r and then it's got a few
parameter set and then line 10 is just saying hey you know we're going to knit
this using these parameters as well and knitting really this is a default adhere
I didn't you'll probably never change this most likely but now pound our

00:09
markdown we saw the that hash tag here that pound what I'm gonna call it it's
got the single header you can read that here you see the our markdown how it's
bigger well it's because it's a header it's got that pound if I change this to
double pound and then I run it know how do I knit I can check that or I could
serve the site we'll get into that later so let's let's forget about changing it
for now but there's way so there's a couple of things I'm gonna show you in
future tutorials when you update I can make it so that you can update this and
you'll have a browser open and as you update it changes it on the browser so
you truly get to know what it looks like in real time right we haven't got that
far yet so I'm gonna keep this all the same for now I'm just describing the
bits and pieces now this is an hour markdown document look at it down here
in the actual thing this is an arm work down document it's nice right and you
even have a link you could see that the link has the brackets and that's just
basically the our markdown syntax so we know it's kind of highlighted there but

00:10
we know that that's a hyperlink because it's got the bracket notation here
anyways you also have the cars data set so not empty cars but just cars my
favorite is empty cars I guess but anyways they didn't they're just calling
us cars so you can name your chunks we haven't talked about that too much but
every chunk can have a name so you can use the name to advantage for different
things you can call chunks from other parts of the code you can recall a chunk
kind of like a function but we didn't get into that either but anyways in this
code we have the summary of cars we have a model oh we've already talked about
linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we
modeling here let's just go and do a little a little backtracking here we
have a linear model we're gonna say hey I want to know if distance can be
explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the
chunk called pi they have a figure caption which is automatically
captioning things and then Tidy equals falls I don't remember what that e what
that means but that's all it is but that's it that's it right there now
let's let's go back to our files here I already gave up on the instructions so I
apologize but I want to kind of give you an idea of what's going on with all
these files because you've created a lot
of files with this one project and so we have the config dot Tamil I believe I

00:12
can edit that here yeah here we go so right here I just clicked on config dot
Tomo T om l and you have all kinds of configuration settings and you can add
more and change things and we're gonna be going into these to make those
changes like these Twitter sites github sites you've change them to your own
then you can add all kinds of different parameters to help help you out logo dot
PNG where is that located we can go find that out as well
so let's get out of the config dot Tomo and I'm going to show you more about
this file structure here so we also have what we have content and we have public
those are the two I want you to focus on
the content is actually where you create the content right if I have a post so
this blog post right here 2015 oh seven twenty three our markdown ARMD you know
that file name is under content let's actually check that out because that's
actually pretty important so let's go to this is not it but documents I think I

00:13
did yeah well site test okay my first our site with you go don't click on that
and I said contents important let's double click on content what do we have
I have about MD but that's not a post you saw the about page but then I have
this post folder so let's go to post now these it's confusing because this isn't
really a post on your website this is a post that we could put on our website
and when we choose to render this and push it to the get lab or the net lift
fee right all these free services that will host websites for free then it'll
be a real post but these are like basically pending posts and what do we
have here we have MD file so a markdown file we have an RMD file and let's
scroll down here we have 2015 oh seven 23 2015 7 23 are marked down to our MD
so the RMD file is what we're dealing with which is located here that's truly
where this file is located it under the our environment that's very important

00:14
now because it's confusing let's go back
to the beginning here and let's click on
public now in public these are different are well not are you should never have
to interact with public don't mess with public until you really know what you're
doing because the are when you render this finally when you generate the site
are will push all of that information to this public folder so when you're all
said and done the only thing that your host needs to see
is the public folder so don't get confused so we had post we have a folder
called post here right and we have this 2015 oh seven twenty-three we have
figures we have all these things we didn't do any of that we didn't do any
of that don't post in public for now do not mess with public just mess with
content the content is what you're messing with so if you if you made a

00:15
mistake you don't want that blog you can delete the RMD file regenerate
everything and then your public folder because you regenerated it the public
folder will be updated so let's say you deleted 25 different posts from your
content folder and you didn't update your site they'll still be there and
it'll confuse you so once you update and generate the site
again it takes care of that you can delete your public folder and regenerate
it all day long as long as you have everything you need in the content
that's all I'm trying to say that's very confusing but I think that's enough to
get started today it doesn't seem like much but it's actually doing a
tremendous amount of things in the background that's gonna help us out I'm
gonna show you to publish these it's gonna be it's gonna be a pretty fun fun
little tutorial so if you want to follow along some more please do and subscribe

code we have the summary of cars we have a model oh we've already talked about
linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we
modeling here let's just go and do a little a little backtracking here we
have a linear model we're gonna say hey I want to know if distance can be
explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the
chunk called pi they have a figure caption which is automatically
captioning things and then Tidy equals falls I don't remember what that e what
that means but that's all it is but that's it that's it right there now
let's let's go back to our files here I already gave up on the instructions so I
apologize but I want to kind of give you an idea of what's going on with all
these files because you've created a lot
of files with this one project and so we have the config dot Tamil I believe I

00:12
can edit that here yeah here we go so right here I just clicked on config dot
Tomo T om l and you have all kinds of configuration settings and you can add
more and change things and we're gonna be going into these to make those
changes like these Twitter sites github sites you've change them to your own
then you can add all kinds of different parameters to help help you out logo dot

00:13
did yeah well site test okay my first our site with you go don't click on that
and I said contents important let's double click on content what do we have
I have about MD but that's not a post you saw the about page but then I have
this post folder so let's go to post now these it's confusing because this isn't
really a post on your website this is a post that we could put on our website
and when we choose to render this and push it to the get lab or the net lift
fee right all these free services that will host websites for free then it'll
be a real post but these are like basically pending posts and what do we
have here we have MD file so a markdown file we have an RMD file and let's
scroll down here we have 2015 oh seven 23 2015 7 23 are marked down to our MD
so the RMD file is what we're dealing with which is located here that's truly
where this file is located it under the our environment that's very important

00:14
now because it's confusing let's go back
to the beginning here and let's click on
public now in public these are different are well not are you should never have
to interact with public don't mess with public until you really know what you're
doing because the are when you render this finally when you generate the site
are will push all of that information to this public folder so when you're all
said and done the only thing that your host needs to see
is the public folder so don't get confused so we had post we have a folder
called post here right and we have this 2015 oh seven twenty-three we have
figures we have all these things we didn't do any of that we didn't do any
of that don't post in public for now do not mess with public just mess with
content the content is what you're messing with so if you if you made a

00:15
mistake you don't want that blog you can delete the RMD file regenerate
everything and then your public folder because you regenerated it the public
folder will be updated so let's say you deleted 25 different posts from your
content folder and you didn't update your site they'll still be there and
it'll confuse you so once you update and generate the site
again it takes care of that you can delete your public folder and regenerate
it all day long as long as you have everything you need in the content
that's all I'm trying to say that's very confusing but I think that's enough to
get started today it doesn't seem like much but it's actually doing a
tremendous amount of things in the background that's gonna help us out I'm
gonna show you to publish these it's gonna be it's gonna be a pretty fun fun
little tutorial so if you want to follow along some more please do and subscribe
like et cetera and comment below if you have any issues I'll try to answer them

00:16
comment below if you have already created one or want to just say hi so I
will see you guys in the next one you [Music]End of file

00:00
welcome back to cradle-to-grave our my name is Mark and I'm gonna show you
today in this series actually I'm going to show you how to create websites use
an R and a theme called Hugo which is written in the NGO language and how to
actually publish these to the websites right for free all of it completely free
the only thing that would cost money is if you wanted your own specific domain
name like cradle-to-grave are calm that would cost you like 12
bucks a year other than that we're gonna create a dynamic static site now I say
that because it's static but it's dynamic because you can update it with
our click a couple buttons and the site has been updated you can also add in
third-party add-ons that'll add like a discuss channel or discuss add-on to
your blogs where people can actually comment so it's a static site
technically but it's gonna be very dynamic in nature so stay tuned what

00:01
what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna take my current our site down completely
from the WordPress site that I have which is I don't I don't want to pay the
money for it anymore and I'm gonna create that site using our
and I'll show you how to do that in this little miniseries I'm gonna put
together we're gonna create some actual websites using our to publish them and
do every all the work we're not going to really just use our though we're gonna
we're going to download a couple of packages we're going to use Hugo as a
theme generator and we're gonna create a static website that's not really static
it's just technically it's static but it's actually dynamic you're gonna
create blogs you're going to be able to update them you're going to be able to
publish them for free using either get labs github or net Liffey and you can
also have your own unique domain name now that part cost so if you own the

00:02
domain name for you know twelve bucks a year you can definitely tie it to net
low fee and get labs if you don't own your own domain name you can still do
this so follow along it's a completely free everything about this is free
except for if you own your own domain name so if you get stuck at any time and
I'm confusing you there's a website called blog down org where I've learned
most of these instructions so I'm just putting it in video format and I'm gonna
add to it as we go but what you want to do is you want to install a package
called blog down first I'm not going to click install because
I've already installed it but when you do that it should take maybe a couple of
minutes depending on your internet connection it's gonna install all the
dependencies everything it needs to get blogged down started now once you do
that there's also another set of tools you'd want to download called dev tools
now if you go to install again if I'm if you're still installing blog down I
recommend pause in this video so that blog down can finish installing so it's

00:03
called dev tools and you can download that just by doing the same thing go to
the package manager packages install and type in dev tools install now the next
thing you want to do after that works you want to use the blog down you just
type in blog down colon colon so that's the name space the scope of this
function I'm gonna use a function called install Hugo as you can see below so it
says install Hugo I've already done that as well that's about as far as I
gotta know so the rest is just basically
new for me so once you do that I'm gonna actually run that and see what it says
so it's gonna install Hugo which is a theme
Hugo is a theme for websites built using the go language you don't have to know
any of that right now you don't have to know anything about HTML nothing you
just literally install it and it does its thing so it's installed Hugo has been
installed that was that that was very simple
luckily blogged down made it easy to install Hugo that's basically what's

00:04
going on here now the best way to learn anything is to actually create the
example right so within just minutes we're gonna create the example file new
project I don't care about saving this one I want to go to a new directory and
I call it a new project you could do now that I have blogged down I could say
website using blog down but let's just go with new project so we could start
from scratch and say hey no we're not gonna do that I'm going to create a in
my documents I will create a new folder called site tests whatever you want to
call it that's where I'm gonna place this new site and this will be my first
our site with Hugo whatever you want to call it anyways
let's create the project and you'll see it's just a blank project like like all
of your projects are when you first start just like this so the next thing
you want to do and this is so simple is you just type in new underscore I'm

00:05
sorry blog down blog down new underscore site boom and now it's gonna generate
everything I need to create a website through our you can see my computer's
pretty fast but you see over here in the viewer I already have a website in fact
I could pop this out I think somehow maybe pop it out boom oh wow when I pop
it out it actually goes to it actually goes to my browser that is default so
that's cool so I'll just keep this up here in this area and show you that look
here these are two blogs this is a link li I'm not sure what that is about page
if I click on it you get to it and you can hit back I can actually check out my
log post with code this is pretty interesting so you're already there
you've already created a website now Grenda this is locally hosted on your
computer I'm gonna X that out you can also do those things within the viewer

00:06
here as you can see I will actually change me to be a little bit higher I
suppose in fact I wanted me to be this big I think very small I want me to just
be a talking head so we've got that talking head going now this works I mean
within here I can click on about I can click on github and then github is
actually a link so it actually will pull up your your link and Twitter and all
that stuff there's many things you can do so this is really cool stuff to do
with our and eventually I'm going to show you guys how to use git labs and
actually publish straight from our so you're gonna be doing code in fact I
didn't even I didn't I've used this a long time ago but without reading the
instructions I'm gonna show you what this file is I'm gonna give you what's
going on here so first let's go to the files here so let's start let's start up
there in this file setup here it's going to be in that directory that I had so
when I go to my file explorer I can go to file explorer here bring it on over

00:07
and go to documents and I called that site test my first are with Hugo and now
you see all of these different files I'm not gonna play with it here within the
Explorer because it's already down here in my our Studio IDE so under files if
you click on the files tab you'll see the same thing a couple of things to
know you want a config file which is called config dot T om l and t om l is
like you know you've probably heard of ya mol yet another markdown language
it's just another markdown language to have the interpreters interpret these
things as as as they should be right I have an indexed at RM d and if you look
at the title of this actual tab here it's it's actually like a post it's a
hello our markdown right and if we go back to the viewer
just click on that if I go back to the main site right here a plain markdown

00:08
pose 2016 hello are marked down so that this right here is this post so when I
click on it you can read this post and it's just an RMD file and I know I've
showed you guys some RMD file some markdown files so let's take a look at
it the only thing that's slightly different actually not even because
you've seen this ya mole code before 1 through 7 if you follow the rest of the
tutorials I believe that's just animal code it's it's got a title hello our
markdown that's a title of my blog who's the author what's the date categories
you can configure a lot of this stuff elsewhere but we'll get into that in
future tutorials now we have a code chunk what is this code chunk well it's
our because it's backtick backtick backtick r and then it's got a few
parameter set and then line 10 is just saying hey you know we're going to knit
this using these parameters as well and knitting really this is a default adhere
I didn't you'll probably never change this most likely but now pound our

00:09
markdown we saw the that hash tag here that pound what I'm gonna call it it's
got the single header you can read that here you see the our markdown how it's
bigger well it's because it's a header it's got that pound if I change this to
double pound and then I run it know how do I knit I can check that or I could
serve the site we'll get into that later so let's let's forget about changing it
for now but there's way so there's a couple of things I'm gonna show you in
future tutorials when you update I can make it so that you can update this and
you'll have a browser open and as you update it changes it on the browser so
you truly get to know what it looks like in real time right we haven't got that
far yet so I'm gonna keep this all the same for now I'm just describing the
bits and pieces now this is an hour markdown document look at it down here
in the actual thing this is an arm work down document it's nice right and you
even have a link you could see that the link has the brackets and that's just
basically the our markdown syntax so we know it's kind of highlighted there but

00:10
we know that that's a hyperlink because it's got the bracket notation here
anyways you also have the cars data set so not empty cars but just cars my
favorite is empty cars I guess but anyways they didn't they're just calling
us cars so you can name your chunks we haven't talked about that too much but
every chunk can have a name so you can use the name to advantage for different
things you can call chunks from other parts of the code you can recall a chunk
kind of like a function but we didn't get into that either but anyways in this
code we have the summary of cars we have a model oh we've already talked about
linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we
modeling here let's just go and do a little a little backtracking here we
have a linear model we're gonna say hey I want to know if distance can be
explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the
chunk called pi they have a figure caption which is automatically
captioning things and then Tidy equals falls I don't remember what that e what
that means but that's all it is but that's it that's it right there now
let's let's go back to our files here I already gave up on the instructions so I
apologize but I want to kind of give you an idea of what's going on with all
these files because you've created a lot
of files with this one project and so we have the config dot Tamil I believe I

00:12
can edit that here yeah here we go so right here I just clicked on config dot
Tomo T om l and you have all kinds of configuration settings and you can add
more and change things and we're gonna be going into these to make those
changes like these Twitter sites github sites you've change them to your own
then you can add all kinds of different parameters to help help you out logo dot
PNG where is that located we can go find that out as well
so let's get out of the config dot Tomo and I'm going to show you more about
this file structure here so we also have what we have content and we have public
those are the two I want you to focus on
the content is actually where you create the content right if I have a post so
this blog post right here 2015 oh seven twenty three our markdown ARMD you know
that file name is under content let's actually check that out because that's
actually pretty important so let's go to this is not it but documents I think I

00:13
did yeah well site test okay my first our site with you go don't click on that
and I said contents important let's double click on content what do we have
I have about MD but that's not a post you saw the about page but then I have
this post folder so let's go to post now these it's confusing because this isn't
really a post on your website this is a post that we could put on our website
and when we choose to render this and push it to the get lab or the net lift
fee right all these free services that will host websites for free then it'll
be a real post but these are like basically pending posts and what do we
have here we have MD file so a markdown file we have an RMD file and let's
scroll down here we have 2015 oh seven 23 2015 7 23 are marked down to our MD
so the RMD file is what we're dealing with which is located here that's truly
where this file is located it under the our environment that's very important

00:14
now because it's confusing let's go back
to the beginning here and let's click on
public now in public these are different are well not are you should never have

called post here right and we have this 2015 oh seven twenty-three we have
figures we have all these things we didn't do any of that we didn't do any
of that don't post in public for now do not mess with public just mess with
content the content is what you're messing with so if you if you made a

00:15
mistake you don't want that blog you can delete the RMD file regenerate
everything and then your public folder because you regenerated it the public
folder will be updated so let's say you deleted 25 different posts from your

code we have the summary of cars we have a model oh we've already talked about
linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we
modeling here let's just go and do a little a little backtracking here we
have a linear model we're gonna say hey I want to know if distance can be
explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the
chunk called pi they have a figure caption which is automatically
captioning things and then Tidy equals falls I don't remember what that e what
that means but that's all it is but that's it that's it right there now
let's let's go back to our files here I already gave up on the instructions so I
apologize but I want to kind of give you an idea of what's going on with all
these files because you've created a lot
of files with this one project and so we have the config dot Tamil I believe I

00:12
can edit that here yeah here we go so right here I just clicked on config dot
Tomo T om l and you have all kinds of configuration settings and you can add
more and change things and we're gonna be going into these to make those
changes like these Twitter sites github sites you've change them to your own
then you can add all kinds of different parameters to help help you out logo dot
PNG where is that located we can go find that out as well
so let's get out of the config dot Tomo and I'm going to show you more about
this file structure here so we also have what we have content and we have public
those are the two I want you to focus on
the content is actually where you create the content right if I have a post so
this blog post right here 2015 oh seven twenty three our markdown ARMD you know
that file name is under content let's actually check that out because that's
actually pretty important so let's go to this is not it but documents I think I

00:13
did yeah well site test okay my first our site with you go don't click on that
and I said contents important let's double click on content what do we have
I have about MD but that's not a post you saw the about page but then I have
this post folder so let's go to post now these it's confusing because this isn't
really a post on your website this is a post that we could put on our website
and when we choose to render this and push it to the get lab or the net lift
fee right all these free services that will host websites for free then it'll
be a real post but these are like basically pending posts and what do we
have here we have MD file so a markdown file we have an RMD file and let's
scroll down here we have 2015 oh seven 23 2015 7 23 are marked down to our MD
so the RMD file is what we're dealing with which is located here that's truly
where this file is located it under the our environment that's very important

00:14
now because it's confusing let's go back
to the beginning here and let's click on
public now in public these are different are well not are you should never have
to interact with public don't mess with public until you really know what you're
doing because the are when you render this finally when you generate the site
are will push all of that information to this public folder so when you're all
said and done the only thing that your host needs to see
is the public folder so don't get confused so we had post we have a folder
called post here right and we have this 2015 oh seven twenty-three we have
figures we have all these things we didn't do any of that we didn't do any
of that don't post in public for now do not mess with public just mess with
content the content is what you're messing with so if you if you made a

00:15
mistake you don't want that blog you can delete the RMD file regenerate
everything and then your public folder because you regenerated it the public
folder will be updated so let's say you deleted 25 different posts from your
content folder and you didn't update your site they'll still be there and
it'll confuse you so once you update and generate the site
again it takes care of that you can delete your public folder and regenerate
it all day long as long as you have everything you need in the content
that's all I'm trying to say that's very confusing but I think that's enough to
get started today it doesn't seem like much but it's actually doing a
tremendous amount of things in the background that's gonna help us out I'm
gonna show you to publish these it's gonna be it's gonna be a pretty fun fun
little tutorial so if you want to follow along some more please do and subscribe
like et cetera and comment below if you have any issues I'll try to answer them

00:16
comment below if you have already created one or want to just say hi so I
will see you guys in the next one you [Music]End of file

00:00
welcome back to cradle-to-grave our my name is Mark and I'm gonna show you
today in this series actually I'm going to show you how to create websites use
an R and a theme called Hugo which is written in the NGO language and how to
actually publish these to the websites right for free all of it completely free
the only thing that would cost money is if you wanted your own specific domain
name like cradle-to-grave are calm that would cost you like 12
bucks a year other than that we're gonna create a dynamic static site now I say
that because it's static but it's dynamic because you can update it with
our click a couple buttons and the site has been updated you can also add in
third-party add-ons that'll add like a discuss channel or discuss add-on to
your blogs where people can actually comment so it's a static site
technically but it's gonna be very dynamic in nature so stay tuned what

00:01
what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna take my current our site down completely
from the WordPress site that I have which is I don't I don't want to pay the
money for it anymore and I'm gonna create that site using our
and I'll show you how to do that in this little miniseries I'm gonna put
together we're gonna create some actual websites using our to publish them and
do every all the work we're not going to really just use our though we're gonna
we're going to download a couple of packages we're going to use Hugo as a
theme generator and we're gonna create a static website that's not really static
it's just technically it's static but it's actually dynamic you're gonna
create blogs you're going to be able to update them you're going to be able to
publish them for free using either get labs github or net Liffey and you can
also have your own unique domain name now that part cost so if you own the

00:02
domain name for you know twelve bucks a year you can definitely tie it to net
low fee and get labs if you don't own your own domain name you can still do
this so follow along it's a completely free everything about this is free
except for if you own your own domain name so if you get stuck at any time and
I'm confusing you there's a website called blog down org where I've learned
most of these instructions so I'm just putting it in video format and I'm gonna
add to it as we go but what you want to do is you want to install a package
called blog down first I'm not going to click install because
I've already installed it but when you do that it should take maybe a couple of
minutes depending on your internet connection it's gonna install all the
dependencies everything it needs to get blogged down started now once you do
that there's also another set of tools you'd want to download called dev tools
now if you go to install again if I'm if you're still installing blog down I
recommend pause in this video so that blog down can finish installing so it's

00:03
called dev tools and you can download that just by doing the same thing go to
the package manager packages install and type in dev tools install now the next
thing you want to do after that works you want to use the blog down you just
type in blog down colon colon so that's the name space the scope of this
function I'm gonna use a function called install Hugo as you can see below so it
says install Hugo I've already done that as well that's about as far as I
gotta know so the rest is just basically
new for me so once you do that I'm gonna actually run that and see what it says
so it's gonna install Hugo which is a theme
Hugo is a theme for websites built using the go language you don't have to know
any of that right now you don't have to know anything about HTML nothing you
just literally install it and it does its thing so it's installed Hugo has been
installed that was that that was very simple
luckily blogged down made it easy to install Hugo that's basically what's

00:04
going on here now the best way to learn anything is to actually create the
example right so within just minutes we're gonna create the example file new
project I don't care about saving this one I want to go to a new directory and
I call it a new project you could do now that I have blogged down I could say
website using blog down but let's just go with new project so we could start
from scratch and say hey no we're not gonna do that I'm going to create a in
my documents I will create a new folder called site tests whatever you want to
call it that's where I'm gonna place this new site and this will be my first
our site with Hugo whatever you want to call it anyways
let's create the project and you'll see it's just a blank project like like all
of your projects are when you first start just like this so the next thing
you want to do and this is so simple is you just type in new underscore I'm

00:05
sorry blog down blog down new underscore site boom and now it's gonna generate
everything I need to create a website through our you can see my computer's
pretty fast but you see over here in the viewer I already have a website in fact
I could pop this out I think somehow maybe pop it out boom oh wow when I pop
it out it actually goes to it actually goes to my browser that is default so
that's cool so I'll just keep this up here in this area and show you that look
here these are two blogs this is a link li I'm not sure what that is about page
if I click on it you get to it and you can hit back I can actually check out my
log post with code this is pretty interesting so you're already there
you've already created a website now Grenda this is locally hosted on your
computer I'm gonna X that out you can also do those things within the viewer

00:06
here as you can see I will actually change me to be a little bit higher I
suppose in fact I wanted me to be this big I think very small I want me to just
be a talking head so we've got that talking head going now this works I mean
within here I can click on about I can click on github and then github is
actually a link so it actually will pull up your your link and Twitter and all
that stuff there's many things you can do so this is really cool stuff to do
with our and eventually I'm going to show you guys how to use git labs and
actually publish straight from our so you're gonna be doing code in fact I
didn't even I didn't I've used this a long time ago but without reading the
instructions I'm gonna show you what this file is I'm gonna give you what's
going on here so first let's go to the files here so let's start let's start up
there in this file setup here it's going to be in that directory that I had so
when I go to my file explorer I can go to file explorer here bring it on over

00:07
and go to documents and I called that site test my first are with Hugo and now
you see all of these different files I'm not gonna play with it here within the
Explorer because it's already down here in my our Studio IDE so under files if
you click on the files tab you'll see the same thing a couple of things to
know you want a config file which is called config dot T om l and t om l is
like you know you've probably heard of ya mol yet another markdown language
it's just another markdown language to have the interpreters interpret these
things as as as they should be right I have an indexed at RM d and if you look
at the title of this actual tab here it's it's actually like a post it's a
hello our markdown right and if we go back to the viewer
just click on that if I go back to the main site right here a plain markdown

00:08
pose 2016 hello are marked down so that this right here is this post so when I
click on it you can read this post and it's just an RMD file and I know I've
showed you guys some RMD file some markdown files so let's take a look at
it the only thing that's slightly different actually not even because
you've seen this ya mole code before 1 through 7 if you follow the rest of the
tutorials I believe that's just animal code it's it's got a title hello our
markdown that's a title of my blog who's the author what's the date categories
you can configure a lot of this stuff elsewhere but we'll get into that in
future tutorials now we have a code chunk what is this code chunk well it's
our because it's backtick backtick backtick r and then it's got a few
parameter set and then line 10 is just saying hey you know we're going to knit
this using these parameters as well and knitting really this is a default adhere
I didn't you'll probably never change this most likely but now pound our

00:09
markdown we saw the that hash tag here that pound what I'm gonna call it it's
got the single header you can read that here you see the our markdown how it's
bigger well it's because it's a header it's got that pound if I change this to
double pound and then I run it know how do I knit I can check that or I could
serve the site we'll get into that later so let's let's forget about changing it
for now but there's way so there's a couple of things I'm gonna show you in
future tutorials when you update I can make it so that you can update this and
you'll have a browser open and as you update it changes it on the browser so
you truly get to know what it looks like in real time right we haven't got that
far yet so I'm gonna keep this all the same for now I'm just describing the
bits and pieces now this is an hour markdown document look at it down here
in the actual thing this is an arm work down document it's nice right and you
even have a link you could see that the link has the brackets and that's just
basically the our markdown syntax so we know it's kind of highlighted there but

00:10
we know that that's a hyperlink because it's got the bracket notation here
anyways you also have the cars data set so not empty cars but just cars my
favorite is empty cars I guess but anyways they didn't they're just calling
us cars so you can name your chunks we haven't talked about that too much but
every chunk can have a name so you can use the name to advantage for different
things you can call chunks from other parts of the code you can recall a chunk
kind of like a function but we didn't get into that either but anyways in this
code we have the summary of cars we have a model oh we've already talked about
linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we
modeling here let's just go and do a little a little backtracking here we
have a linear model we're gonna say hey I want to know if distance can be
explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the
chunk called pi they have a figure caption which is automatically
captioning things and then Tidy equals falls I don't remember what that e what
that means but that's all it is but that's it that's it right there now
let's let's go back to our files here I already gave up on the instructions so I
apologize but I want to kind of give you an idea of what's going on with all
these files because you've created a lot
of files with this one project and so we have the config dot Tamil I believe I

00:12
can edit that here yeah here we go so right here I just clicked on config dot
Tomo T om l and you have all kinds of configuration settings and you can add
more and change things and we're gonna be going into these to make those
changes like these Twitter sites github sites you've change them to your own
then you can add all kinds of different parameters to help help you out logo dot

00:13
did yeah well site test okay my first our site with you go don't click on that
and I said contents important let's double click on content what do we have
I have about MD but that's not a post you saw the about page but then I have

favorite is empty cars I guess but anyways they didn't they're just calling
us cars so you can name your chunks we haven't talked about that too much but
every chunk can have a name so you can use the name to advantage for different
things you can call chunks from other parts of the code you can recall a chunk
kind of like a function but we didn't get into that either but anyways in this
code we have the summary of cars we have a model oh we've already talked about
linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we
modeling here let's just go and do a little a little backtracking here we
have a linear model we're gonna say hey I want to know if distance can be
explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the
chunk called pi they have a figure caption which is automatically
captioning things and then Tidy equals falls I don't remember what that e what
that means but that's all it is but that's it that's it right there now
let's let's go back to our files here I already gave up on the instructions so I
apologize but I want to kind of give you an idea of what's going on with all
these files because you've created a lot
of files with this one project and so we have the config dot Tamil I believe I

00:12
can edit that here yeah here we go so right here I just clicked on config dot
Tomo T om l and you have all kinds of configuration settings and you can add
more and change things and we're gonna be going into these to make those
changes like these Twitter sites github sites you've change them to your own
then you can add all kinds of different parameters to help help you out logo dot
PNG where is that located we can go find that out as well
so let's get out of the config dot Tomo and I'm going to show you more about
this file structure here so we also have what we have content and we have public
those are the two I want you to focus on
the content is actually where you create the content right if I have a post so
this blog post right here 2015 oh seven twenty three our markdown ARMD you know
that file name is under content let's actually check that out because that's
actually pretty important so let's go to this is not it but documents I think I

00:13
did yeah well site test okay my first our site with you go don't click on that
and I said contents important let's double click on content what do we have
I have about MD but that's not a post you saw the about page but then I have
this post folder so let's go to post now these it's confusing because this isn't
really a post on your website this is a post that we could put on our website
and when we choose to render this and push it to the get lab or the net lift
fee right all these free services that will host websites for free then it'll
be a real post but these are like basically pending posts and what do we
have here we have MD file so a markdown file we have an RMD file and let's
scroll down here we have 2015 oh seven 23 2015 7 23 are marked down to our MD
so the RMD file is what we're dealing with which is located here that's truly
where this file is located it under the our environment that's very important

00:14
now because it's confusing let's go back
to the beginning here and let's click on
public now in public these are different are well not are you should never have
to interact with public don't mess with public until you really know what you're
doing because the are when you render this finally when you generate the site
are will push all of that information to this public folder so when you're all
said and done the only thing that your host needs to see
is the public folder so don't get confused so we had post we have a folder
called post here right and we have this 2015 oh seven twenty-three we have
figures we have all these things we didn't do any of that we didn't do any
of that don't post in public for now do not mess with public just mess with
content the content is what you're messing with so if you if you made a

00:15
mistake you don't want that blog you can delete the RMD file regenerate
everything and then your public folder because you regenerated it the public
folder will be updated so let's say you deleted 25 different posts from your
content folder and you didn't update your site they'll still be there and
it'll confuse you so once you update and generate the site
again it takes care of that you can delete your public folder and regenerate
it all day long as long as you have everything you need in the content
that's all I'm trying to say that's very confusing but I think that's enough to
get started today it doesn't seem like much but it's actually doing a
tremendous amount of things in the background that's gonna help us out I'm
gonna show you to publish these it's gonna be it's gonna be a pretty fun fun
little tutorial so if you want to follow along some more please do and subscribe
like et cetera and comment below if you have any issues I'll try to answer them

00:16
comment below if you have already created one or want to just say hi so I
will see you guys in the next one you [Music]End of file

00:00
welcome back to cradle-to-grave our my name is Mark and I'm gonna show you
today in this series actually I'm going to show you how to create websites use
an R and a theme called Hugo which is written in the NGO language and how to
actually publish these to the websites right for free all of it completely free
the only thing that would cost money is if you wanted your own specific domain
name like cradle-to-grave are calm that would cost you like 12
bucks a year other than that we're gonna create a dynamic static site now I say
that because it's static but it's dynamic because you can update it with
our click a couple buttons and the site has been updated you can also add in
third-party add-ons that'll add like a discuss channel or discuss add-on to
your blogs where people can actually comment so it's a static site
technically but it's gonna be very dynamic in nature so stay tuned what

00:01
what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna take my current our site down completely
from the WordPress site that I have which is I don't I don't want to pay the
money for it anymore and I'm gonna create that site using our
and I'll show you how to do that in this little miniseries I'm gonna put
together we're gonna create some actual websites using our to publish them and
do every all the work we're not going to really just use our though we're gonna
we're going to download a couple of packages we're going to use Hugo as a
theme generator and we're gonna create a static website that's not really static
it's just technically it's static but it's actually dynamic you're gonna
create blogs you're going to be able to update them you're going to be able to
publish them for free using either get labs github or net Liffey and you can
also have your own unique domain name now that part cost so if you own the

00:02
domain name for you know twelve bucks a year you can definitely tie it to net
low fee and get labs if you don't own your own domain name you can still do
this so follow along it's a completely free everything about this is free
except for if you own your own domain name so if you get stuck at any time and
I'm confusing you there's a website called blog down org where I've learned
most of these instructions so I'm just putting it in video format and I'm gonna
add to it as we go but what you want to do is you want to install a package
called blog down first I'm not going to click install because
I've already installed it but when you do that it should take maybe a couple of
minutes depending on your internet connection it's gonna install all the
dependencies everything it needs to get blogged down started now once you do
that there's also another set of tools you'd want to download called dev tools
now if you go to install again if I'm if you're still installing blog down I
recommend pause in this video so that blog down can finish installing so it's

00:03
called dev tools and you can download that just by doing the same thing go to
the package manager packages install and type in dev tools install now the next
thing you want to do after that works you want to use the blog down you just
type in blog down colon colon so that's the name space the scope of this
function I'm gonna use a function called install Hugo as you can see below so it
says install Hugo I've already done that as well that's about as far as I
gotta know so the rest is just basically
new for me so once you do that I'm gonna actually run that and see what it says
so it's gonna install Hugo which is a theme
Hugo is a theme for websites built using the go language you don't have to know
any of that right now you don't have to know anything about HTML nothing you
just literally install it and it does its thing so it's installed Hugo has been
installed that was that that was very simple
luckily blogged down made it easy to install Hugo that's basically what's

00:04
going on here now the best way to learn anything is to actually create the
example right so within just minutes we're gonna create the example file new
project I don't care about saving this one I want to go to a new directory and
I call it a new project you could do now that I have blogged down I could say
website using blog down but let's just go with new project so we could start
from scratch and say hey no we're not gonna do that I'm going to create a in
my documents I will create a new folder called site tests whatever you want to
call it that's where I'm gonna place this new site and this will be my first
our site with Hugo whatever you want to call it anyways
let's create the project and you'll see it's just a blank project like like all
of your projects are when you first start just like this so the next thing
you want to do and this is so simple is you just type in new underscore I'm

00:05
sorry blog down blog down new underscore site boom and now it's gonna generate
everything I need to create a website through our you can see my computer's
pretty fast but you see over here in the viewer I already have a website in fact
I could pop this out I think somehow maybe pop it out boom oh wow when I pop
it out it actually goes to it actually goes to my browser that is default so
that's cool so I'll just keep this up here in this area and show you that look
here these are two blogs this is a link li I'm not sure what that is about page
if I click on it you get to it and you can hit back I can actually check out my
log post with code this is pretty interesting so you're already there
you've already created a website now Grenda this is locally hosted on your
computer I'm gonna X that out you can also do those things within the viewer

00:06
here as you can see I will actually change me to be a little bit higher I
suppose in fact I wanted me to be this big I think very small I want me to just
be a talking head so we've got that talking head going now this works I mean
within here I can click on about I can click on github and then github is
actually a link so it actually will pull up your your link and Twitter and all
that stuff there's many things you can do so this is really cool stuff to do
with our and eventually I'm going to show you guys how to use git labs and
actually publish straight from our so you're gonna be doing code in fact I
didn't even I didn't I've used this a long time ago but without reading the
instructions I'm gonna show you what this file is I'm gonna give you what's
going on here so first let's go to the files here so let's start let's start up
there in this file setup here it's going to be in that directory that I had so
when I go to my file explorer I can go to file explorer here bring it on over

00:07
and go to documents and I called that site test my first are with Hugo and now
you see all of these different files I'm not gonna play with it here within the
Explorer because it's already down here in my our Studio IDE so under files if
you click on the files tab you'll see the same thing a couple of things to
know you want a config file which is called config dot T om l and t om l is
like you know you've probably heard of ya mol yet another markdown language
it's just another markdown language to have the interpreters interpret these
things as as as they should be right I have an indexed at RM d and if you look
at the title of this actual tab here it's it's actually like a post it's a
hello our markdown right and if we go back to the viewer
just click on that if I go back to the main site right here a plain markdown

00:08
pose 2016 hello are marked down so that this right here is this post so when I
click on it you can read this post and it's just an RMD file and I know I've
showed you guys some RMD file some markdown files so let's take a look at
it the only thing that's slightly different actually not even because
you've seen this ya mole code before 1 through 7 if you follow the rest of the
tutorials I believe that's just animal code it's it's got a title hello our
markdown that's a title of my blog who's the author what's the date categories
you can configure a lot of this stuff elsewhere but we'll get into that in
future tutorials now we have a code chunk what is this code chunk well it's
our because it's backtick backtick backtick r and then it's got a few
parameter set and then line 10 is just saying hey you know we're going to knit
this using these parameters as well and knitting really this is a default adhere
I didn't you'll probably never change this most likely but now pound our

00:09
markdown we saw the that hash tag here that pound what I'm gonna call it it's
got the single header you can read that here you see the our markdown how it's
bigger well it's because it's a header it's got that pound if I change this to
double pound and then I run it know how do I knit I can check that or I could
serve the site we'll get into that later so let's let's forget about changing it
for now but there's way so there's a couple of things I'm gonna show you in
future tutorials when you update I can make it so that you can update this and
you'll have a browser open and as you update it changes it on the browser so
you truly get to know what it looks like in real time right we haven't got that
far yet so I'm gonna keep this all the same for now I'm just describing the
bits and pieces now this is an hour markdown document look at it down here
in the actual thing this is an arm work down document it's nice right and you
even have a link you could see that the link has the brackets and that's just
basically the our markdown syntax so we know it's kind of highlighted there but

00:10
we know that that's a hyperlink because it's got the bracket notation here
anyways you also have the cars data set so not empty cars but just cars my
favorite is empty cars I guess but anyways they didn't they're just calling
us cars so you can name your chunks we haven't talked about that too much but
every chunk can have a name so you can use the name to advantage for different
things you can call chunks from other parts of the code you can recall a chunk
kind of like a function but we didn't get into that either but anyways in this
code we have the summary of cars we have a model oh we've already talked about
linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we
modeling here let's just go and do a little a little backtracking here we
have a linear model we're gonna say hey I want to know if distance can be
explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the
chunk called pi they have a figure caption which is automatically
captioning things and then Tidy equals falls I don't remember what that e what
that means but that's all it is but that's it that's it right there now
let's let's go back to our files here I already gave up on the instructions so I
apologize but I want to kind of give you an idea of what's going on with all
these files because you've created a lot
of files with this one project and so we have the config dot Tamil I believe I

00:12
can edit that here yeah here we go so right here I just clicked on config dot
Tomo T om l and you have all kinds of configuration settings and you can add
more and change things and we're gonna be going into these to make those
changes like these Twitter sites github sites you've change them to your own
then you can add all kinds of different parameters to help help you out logo dot
PNG where is that located we can go find that out as well
so let's get out of the config dot Tomo and I'm going to show you more about
this file structure here so we also have what we have content and we have public
those are the two I want you to focus on
the content is actually where you create the content right if I have a post so
this blog post right here 2015 oh seven twenty three our markdown ARMD you know
that file name is under content let's actually check that out because that's
actually pretty important so let's go to this is not it but documents I think I

00:13
did yeah well site test okay my first our site with you go don't click on that
and I said contents important let's double click on content what do we have
I have about MD but that's not a post you saw the about page but then I have
this post folder so let's go to post now these it's confusing because this isn't
really a post on your website this is a post that we could put on our website

parameter set and then line 10 is just saying hey you know we're going to knit
this using these parameters as well and knitting really this is a default adhere
I didn't you'll probably never change this most likely but now pound our

00:09
markdown we saw the that hash tag here that pound what I'm gonna call it it's
got the single header you can read that here you see the our markdown how it's
bigger well it's because it's a header it's got that pound if I change this to
double pound and then I run it know how do I knit I can check that or I could
serve the site we'll get into that later so let's let's forget about changing it
for now but there's way so there's a couple of things I'm gonna show you in
future tutorials when you update I can make it so that you can update this and
you'll have a browser open and as you update it changes it on the browser so
you truly get to know what it looks like in real time right we haven't got that
far yet so I'm gonna keep this all the same for now I'm just describing the
bits and pieces now this is an hour markdown document look at it down here
in the actual thing this is an arm work down document it's nice right and you
even have a link you could see that the link has the brackets and that's just
basically the our markdown syntax so we know it's kind of highlighted there but

00:10
we know that that's a hyperlink because it's got the bracket notation here
anyways you also have the cars data set so not empty cars but just cars my
favorite is empty cars I guess but anyways they didn't they're just calling
us cars so you can name your chunks we haven't talked about that too much but
every chunk can have a name so you can use the name to advantage for different
things you can call chunks from other parts of the code you can recall a chunk
kind of like a function but we didn't get into that either but anyways in this
code we have the summary of cars we have a model oh we've already talked about
linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we
modeling here let's just go and do a little a little backtracking here we
have a linear model we're gonna say hey I want to know if distance can be
explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the
chunk called pi they have a figure caption which is automatically
captioning things and then Tidy equals falls I don't remember what that e what
that means but that's all it is but that's it that's it right there now
let's let's go back to our files here I already gave up on the instructions so I
apologize but I want to kind of give you an idea of what's going on with all
these files because you've created a lot
of files with this one project and so we have the config dot Tamil I believe I

00:12
can edit that here yeah here we go so right here I just clicked on config dot
Tomo T om l and you have all kinds of configuration settings and you can add
more and change things and we're gonna be going into these to make those
changes like these Twitter sites github sites you've change them to your own
then you can add all kinds of different parameters to help help you out logo dot
PNG where is that located we can go find that out as well
so let's get out of the config dot Tomo and I'm going to show you more about
this file structure here so we also have what we have content and we have public
those are the two I want you to focus on
the content is actually where you create the content right if I have a post so
this blog post right here 2015 oh seven twenty three our markdown ARMD you know
that file name is under content let's actually check that out because that's
actually pretty important so let's go to this is not it but documents I think I

00:13
did yeah well site test okay my first our site with you go don't click on that
and I said contents important let's double click on content what do we have
I have about MD but that's not a post you saw the about page but then I have
this post folder so let's go to post now these it's confusing because this isn't
really a post on your website this is a post that we could put on our website
and when we choose to render this and push it to the get lab or the net lift
fee right all these free services that will host websites for free then it'll
be a real post but these are like basically pending posts and what do we
have here we have MD file so a markdown file we have an RMD file and let's
scroll down here we have 2015 oh seven 23 2015 7 23 are marked down to our MD
so the RMD file is what we're dealing with which is located here that's truly
where this file is located it under the our environment that's very important

00:14
now because it's confusing let's go back
to the beginning here and let's click on
public now in public these are different are well not are you should never have
to interact with public don't mess with public until you really know what you're
doing because the are when you render this finally when you generate the site
are will push all of that information to this public folder so when you're all
said and done the only thing that your host needs to see
is the public folder so don't get confused so we had post we have a folder
called post here right and we have this 2015 oh seven twenty-three we have
figures we have all these things we didn't do any of that we didn't do any
of that don't post in public for now do not mess with public just mess with
content the content is what you're messing with so if you if you made a

00:15
mistake you don't want that blog you can delete the RMD file regenerate
everything and then your public folder because you regenerated it the public
folder will be updated so let's say you deleted 25 different posts from your
content folder and you didn't update your site they'll still be there and
it'll confuse you so once you update and generate the site
again it takes care of that you can delete your public folder and regenerate
it all day long as long as you have everything you need in the content
that's all I'm trying to say that's very confusing but I think that's enough to
get started today it doesn't seem like much but it's actually doing a
tremendous amount of things in the background that's gonna help us out I'm
gonna show you to publish these it's gonna be it's gonna be a pretty fun fun
little tutorial so if you want to follow along some more please do and subscribe
like et cetera and comment below if you have any issues I'll try to answer them

00:16
comment below if you have already created one or want to just say hi so I
will see you guys in the next one you [Music]End of file

00:00
welcome back to cradle-to-grave our my name is Mark and I'm gonna show you
today in this series actually I'm going to show you how to create websites use
an R and a theme called Hugo which is written in the NGO language and how to
actually publish these to the websites right for free all of it completely free
the only thing that would cost money is if you wanted your own specific domain
name like cradle-to-grave are calm that would cost you like 12
bucks a year other than that we're gonna create a dynamic static site now I say
that because it's static but it's dynamic because you can update it with
our click a couple buttons and the site has been updated you can also add in
third-party add-ons that'll add like a discuss channel or discuss add-on to
your blogs where people can actually comment so it's a static site
technically but it's gonna be very dynamic in nature so stay tuned what

00:01
what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna take my current our site down completely
from the WordPress site that I have which is I don't I don't want to pay the
money for it anymore and I'm gonna create that site using our
and I'll show you how to do that in this little miniseries I'm gonna put
together we're gonna create some actual websites using our to publish them and
do every all the work we're not going to really just use our though we're gonna
we're going to download a couple of packages we're going to use Hugo as a
theme generator and we're gonna create a static website that's not really static
it's just technically it's static but it's actually dynamic you're gonna
create blogs you're going to be able to update them you're going to be able to
publish them for free using either get labs github or net Liffey and you can
also have your own unique domain name now that part cost so if you own the

00:02
domain name for you know twelve bucks a year you can definitely tie it to net
low fee and get labs if you don't own your own domain name you can still do
this so follow along it's a completely free everything about this is free
except for if you own your own domain name so if you get stuck at any time and
I'm confusing you there's a website called blog down org where I've learned
most of these instructions so I'm just putting it in video format and I'm gonna
add to it as we go but what you want to do is you want to install a package
called blog down first I'm not going to click install because
I've already installed it but when you do that it should take maybe a couple of
minutes depending on your internet connection it's gonna install all the
dependencies everything it needs to get blogged down started now once you do
that there's also another set of tools you'd want to download called dev tools
now if you go to install again if I'm if you're still installing blog down I
recommend pause in this video so that blog down can finish installing so it's

00:03
called dev tools and you can download that just by doing the same thing go to
the package manager packages install and type in dev tools install now the next
thing you want to do after that works you want to use the blog down you just
type in blog down colon colon so that's the name space the scope of this
function I'm gonna use a function called install Hugo as you can see below so it
says install Hugo I've already done that as well that's about as far as I
gotta know so the rest is just basically
new for me so once you do that I'm gonna actually run that and see what it says
so it's gonna install Hugo which is a theme
Hugo is a theme for websites built using the go language you don't have to know
any of that right now you don't have to know anything about HTML nothing you
just literally install it and it does its thing so it's installed Hugo has been
installed that was that that was very simple
luckily blogged down made it easy to install Hugo that's basically what's

00:04
going on here now the best way to learn anything is to actually create the
example right so within just minutes we're gonna create the example file new
project I don't care about saving this one I want to go to a new directory and
I call it a new project you could do now that I have blogged down I could say
website using blog down but let's just go with new project so we could start
from scratch and say hey no we're not gonna do that I'm going to create a in
my documents I will create a new folder called site tests whatever you want to
call it that's where I'm gonna place this new site and this will be my first
our site with Hugo whatever you want to call it anyways
let's create the project and you'll see it's just a blank project like like all
of your projects are when you first start just like this so the next thing
you want to do and this is so simple is you just type in new underscore I'm

00:05
sorry blog down blog down new underscore site boom and now it's gonna generate
everything I need to create a website through our you can see my computer's
pretty fast but you see over here in the viewer I already have a website in fact
I could pop this out I think somehow maybe pop it out boom oh wow when I pop
it out it actually goes to it actually goes to my browser that is default so
that's cool so I'll just keep this up here in this area and show you that look
here these are two blogs this is a link li I'm not sure what that is about page
if I click on it you get to it and you can hit back I can actually check out my
log post with code this is pretty interesting so you're already there
you've already created a website now Grenda this is locally hosted on your
computer I'm gonna X that out you can also do those things within the viewer

00:06
here as you can see I will actually change me to be a little bit higher I
suppose in fact I wanted me to be this big I think very small I want me to just
be a talking head so we've got that talking head going now this works I mean
within here I can click on about I can click on github and then github is
actually a link so it actually will pull up your your link and Twitter and all
that stuff there's many things you can do so this is really cool stuff to do
with our and eventually I'm going to show you guys how to use git labs and
actually publish straight from our so you're gonna be doing code in fact I
didn't even I didn't I've used this a long time ago but without reading the
instructions I'm gonna show you what this file is I'm gonna give you what's
going on here so first let's go to the files here so let's start let's start up
there in this file setup here it's going to be in that directory that I had so
when I go to my file explorer I can go to file explorer here bring it on over

00:07
and go to documents and I called that site test my first are with Hugo and now
you see all of these different files I'm not gonna play with it here within the
Explorer because it's already down here in my our Studio IDE so under files if
you click on the files tab you'll see the same thing a couple of things to
know you want a config file which is called config dot T om l and t om l is
like you know you've probably heard of ya mol yet another markdown language
it's just another markdown language to have the interpreters interpret these
things as as as they should be right I have an indexed at RM d and if you look
at the title of this actual tab here it's it's actually like a post it's a
hello our markdown right and if we go back to the viewer
just click on that if I go back to the main site right here a plain markdown

00:08
pose 2016 hello are marked down so that this right here is this post so when I
click on it you can read this post and it's just an RMD file and I know I've
showed you guys some RMD file some markdown files so let's take a look at
it the only thing that's slightly different actually not even because
you've seen this ya mole code before 1 through 7 if you follow the rest of the
tutorials I believe that's just animal code it's it's got a title hello our
markdown that's a title of my blog who's the author what's the date categories
you can configure a lot of this stuff elsewhere but we'll get into that in
future tutorials now we have a code chunk what is this code chunk well it's
our because it's backtick backtick backtick r and then it's got a few
parameter set and then line 10 is just saying hey you know we're going to knit
this using these parameters as well and knitting really this is a default adhere
I didn't you'll probably never change this most likely but now pound our

00:09
markdown we saw the that hash tag here that pound what I'm gonna call it it's
got the single header you can read that here you see the our markdown how it's
bigger well it's because it's a header it's got that pound if I change this to
double pound and then I run it know how do I knit I can check that or I could
serve the site we'll get into that later so let's let's forget about changing it
for now but there's way so there's a couple of things I'm gonna show you in
future tutorials when you update I can make it so that you can update this and
you'll have a browser open and as you update it changes it on the browser so
you truly get to know what it looks like in real time right we haven't got that
far yet so I'm gonna keep this all the same for now I'm just describing the
bits and pieces now this is an hour markdown document look at it down here
in the actual thing this is an arm work down document it's nice right and you
even have a link you could see that the link has the brackets and that's just
basically the our markdown syntax so we know it's kind of highlighted there but

00:10
we know that that's a hyperlink because it's got the bracket notation here
anyways you also have the cars data set so not empty cars but just cars my
favorite is empty cars I guess but anyways they didn't they're just calling
us cars so you can name your chunks we haven't talked about that too much but
every chunk can have a name so you can use the name to advantage for different
things you can call chunks from other parts of the code you can recall a chunk
kind of like a function but we didn't get into that either but anyways in this
code we have the summary of cars we have a model oh we've already talked about
linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we
modeling here let's just go and do a little a little backtracking here we
have a linear model we're gonna say hey I want to know if distance can be
explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the
chunk called pi they have a figure caption which is automatically
captioning things and then Tidy equals falls I don't remember what that e what
that means but that's all it is but that's it that's it right there now
let's let's go back to our files here I already gave up on the instructions so I
apologize but I want to kind of give you an idea of what's going on with all
these files because you've created a lot

so let's get out of the config dot Tomo and I'm going to show you more about
this file structure here so we also have what we have content and we have public
those are the two I want you to focus on
the content is actually where you create the content right if I have a post so
this blog post right here 2015 oh seven twenty three our markdown ARMD you know
that file name is under content let's actually check that out because that's
actually pretty important so let's go to this is not it but documents I think I

00:13
did yeah well site test okay my first our site with you go don't click on that
and I said contents important let's double click on content what do we have
I have about MD but that's not a post you saw the about page but then I have
this post folder so let's go to post now these it's confusing because this isn't

Explorer because it's already down here in my our Studio IDE so under files if
you click on the files tab you'll see the same thing a couple of things to
know you want a config file which is called config dot T om l and t om l is
like you know you've probably heard of ya mol yet another markdown language
it's just another markdown language to have the interpreters interpret these
things as as as they should be right I have an indexed at RM d and if you look
at the title of this actual tab here it's it's actually like a post it's a
hello our markdown right and if we go back to the viewer
just click on that if I go back to the main site right here a plain markdown

00:08
pose 2016 hello are marked down so that this right here is this post so when I
click on it you can read this post and it's just an RMD file and I know I've
showed you guys some RMD file some markdown files so let's take a look at
it the only thing that's slightly different actually not even because
you've seen this ya mole code before 1 through 7 if you follow the rest of the
tutorials I believe that's just animal code it's it's got a title hello our
markdown that's a title of my blog who's the author what's the date categories
you can configure a lot of this stuff elsewhere but we'll get into that in
future tutorials now we have a code chunk what is this code chunk well it's
our because it's backtick backtick backtick r and then it's got a few
parameter set and then line 10 is just saying hey you know we're going to knit
this using these parameters as well and knitting really this is a default adhere
I didn't you'll probably never change this most likely but now pound our

00:09
markdown we saw the that hash tag here that pound what I'm gonna call it it's
got the single header you can read that here you see the our markdown how it's
bigger well it's because it's a header it's got that pound if I change this to
double pound and then I run it know how do I knit I can check that or I could
serve the site we'll get into that later so let's let's forget about changing it
for now but there's way so there's a couple of things I'm gonna show you in
future tutorials when you update I can make it so that you can update this and
you'll have a browser open and as you update it changes it on the browser so
you truly get to know what it looks like in real time right we haven't got that
far yet so I'm gonna keep this all the same for now I'm just describing the
bits and pieces now this is an hour markdown document look at it down here
in the actual thing this is an arm work down document it's nice right and you
even have a link you could see that the link has the brackets and that's just
basically the our markdown syntax so we know it's kind of highlighted there but

00:10
we know that that's a hyperlink because it's got the bracket notation here
anyways you also have the cars data set so not empty cars but just cars my
favorite is empty cars I guess but anyways they didn't they're just calling
us cars so you can name your chunks we haven't talked about that too much but
every chunk can have a name so you can use the name to advantage for different
things you can call chunks from other parts of the code you can recall a chunk
kind of like a function but we didn't get into that either but anyways in this
code we have the summary of cars we have a model oh we've already talked about
linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we
modeling here let's just go and do a little a little backtracking here we
have a linear model we're gonna say hey I want to know if distance can be
explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the
chunk called pi they have a figure caption which is automatically
captioning things and then Tidy equals falls I don't remember what that e what
that means but that's all it is but that's it that's it right there now
let's let's go back to our files here I already gave up on the instructions so I
apologize but I want to kind of give you an idea of what's going on with all
these files because you've created a lot
of files with this one project and so we have the config dot Tamil I believe I

00:12
can edit that here yeah here we go so right here I just clicked on config dot
Tomo T om l and you have all kinds of configuration settings and you can add
more and change things and we're gonna be going into these to make those
changes like these Twitter sites github sites you've change them to your own
then you can add all kinds of different parameters to help help you out logo dot
PNG where is that located we can go find that out as well
so let's get out of the config dot Tomo and I'm going to show you more about
this file structure here so we also have what we have content and we have public
those are the two I want you to focus on
the content is actually where you create the content right if I have a post so
this blog post right here 2015 oh seven twenty three our markdown ARMD you know
that file name is under content let's actually check that out because that's
actually pretty important so let's go to this is not it but documents I think I

00:13
did yeah well site test okay my first our site with you go don't click on that
and I said contents important let's double click on content what do we have
I have about MD but that's not a post you saw the about page but then I have
this post folder so let's go to post now these it's confusing because this isn't
really a post on your website this is a post that we could put on our website
and when we choose to render this and push it to the get lab or the net lift
fee right all these free services that will host websites for free then it'll
be a real post but these are like basically pending posts and what do we
have here we have MD file so a markdown file we have an RMD file and let's
scroll down here we have 2015 oh seven 23 2015 7 23 are marked down to our MD
so the RMD file is what we're dealing with which is located here that's truly
where this file is located it under the our environment that's very important

00:14
now because it's confusing let's go back
to the beginning here and let's click on
public now in public these are different are well not are you should never have
to interact with public don't mess with public until you really know what you're
doing because the are when you render this finally when you generate the site
are will push all of that information to this public folder so when you're all
said and done the only thing that your host needs to see
is the public folder so don't get confused so we had post we have a folder
called post here right and we have this 2015 oh seven twenty-three we have
figures we have all these things we didn't do any of that we didn't do any
of that don't post in public for now do not mess with public just mess with
content the content is what you're messing with so if you if you made a

00:15
mistake you don't want that blog you can delete the RMD file regenerate
everything and then your public folder because you regenerated it the public
folder will be updated so let's say you deleted 25 different posts from your
content folder and you didn't update your site they'll still be there and
it'll confuse you so once you update and generate the site
again it takes care of that you can delete your public folder and regenerate
it all day long as long as you have everything you need in the content
that's all I'm trying to say that's very confusing but I think that's enough to
get started today it doesn't seem like much but it's actually doing a
tremendous amount of things in the background that's gonna help us out I'm
gonna show you to publish these it's gonna be it's gonna be a pretty fun fun
little tutorial so if you want to follow along some more please do and subscribe
like et cetera and comment below if you have any issues I'll try to answer them

00:16
comment below if you have already created one or want to just say hi so I
will see you guys in the next one you [Music]End of file

00:00
welcome back to cradle-to-grave our my name is Mark and I'm gonna show you
today in this series actually I'm going to show you how to create websites use
an R and a theme called Hugo which is written in the NGO language and how to
actually publish these to the websites right for free all of it completely free
the only thing that would cost money is if you wanted your own specific domain
name like cradle-to-grave are calm that would cost you like 12
bucks a year other than that we're gonna create a dynamic static site now I say
that because it's static but it's dynamic because you can update it with
our click a couple buttons and the site has been updated you can also add in
third-party add-ons that'll add like a discuss channel or discuss add-on to
your blogs where people can actually comment so it's a static site
technically but it's gonna be very dynamic in nature so stay tuned what

00:01
what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna take my current our site down completely
from the WordPress site that I have which is I don't I don't want to pay the
money for it anymore and I'm gonna create that site using our
and I'll show you how to do that in this little miniseries I'm gonna put
together we're gonna create some actual websites using our to publish them and
do every all the work we're not going to really just use our though we're gonna
we're going to download a couple of packages we're going to use Hugo as a
theme generator and we're gonna create a static website that's not really static
it's just technically it's static but it's actually dynamic you're gonna
create blogs you're going to be able to update them you're going to be able to
publish them for free using either get labs github or net Liffey and you can
also have your own unique domain name now that part cost so if you own the

00:02
domain name for you know twelve bucks a year you can definitely tie it to net
low fee and get labs if you don't own your own domain name you can still do
this so follow along it's a completely free everything about this is free
except for if you own your own domain name so if you get stuck at any time and
I'm confusing you there's a website called blog down org where I've learned
most of these instructions so I'm just putting it in video format and I'm gonna
add to it as we go but what you want to do is you want to install a package
called blog down first I'm not going to click install because
I've already installed it but when you do that it should take maybe a couple of
minutes depending on your internet connection it's gonna install all the
dependencies everything it needs to get blogged down started now once you do
that there's also another set of tools you'd want to download called dev tools
now if you go to install again if I'm if you're still installing blog down I
recommend pause in this video so that blog down can finish installing so it's

00:03
called dev tools and you can download that just by doing the same thing go to
the package manager packages install and type in dev tools install now the next
thing you want to do after that works you want to use the blog down you just
type in blog down colon colon so that's the name space the scope of this
function I'm gonna use a function called install Hugo as you can see below so it
says install Hugo I've already done that as well that's about as far as I
gotta know so the rest is just basically
new for me so once you do that I'm gonna actually run that and see what it says
so it's gonna install Hugo which is a theme
Hugo is a theme for websites built using the go language you don't have to know
any of that right now you don't have to know anything about HTML nothing you
just literally install it and it does its thing so it's installed Hugo has been
installed that was that that was very simple
luckily blogged down made it easy to install Hugo that's basically what's

00:04
going on here now the best way to learn anything is to actually create the
example right so within just minutes we're gonna create the example file new
project I don't care about saving this one I want to go to a new directory and
I call it a new project you could do now that I have blogged down I could say
website using blog down but let's just go with new project so we could start
from scratch and say hey no we're not gonna do that I'm going to create a in
my documents I will create a new folder called site tests whatever you want to
call it that's where I'm gonna place this new site and this will be my first
our site with Hugo whatever you want to call it anyways
let's create the project and you'll see it's just a blank project like like all
of your projects are when you first start just like this so the next thing
you want to do and this is so simple is you just type in new underscore I'm

00:05
sorry blog down blog down new underscore site boom and now it's gonna generate
everything I need to create a website through our you can see my computer's
pretty fast but you see over here in the viewer I already have a website in fact
I could pop this out I think somehow maybe pop it out boom oh wow when I pop
it out it actually goes to it actually goes to my browser that is default so
that's cool so I'll just keep this up here in this area and show you that look
here these are two blogs this is a link li I'm not sure what that is about page
if I click on it you get to it and you can hit back I can actually check out my
log post with code this is pretty interesting so you're already there
you've already created a website now Grenda this is locally hosted on your
computer I'm gonna X that out you can also do those things within the viewer

00:06
here as you can see I will actually change me to be a little bit higher I
suppose in fact I wanted me to be this big I think very small I want me to just
be a talking head so we've got that talking head going now this works I mean
within here I can click on about I can click on github and then github is
actually a link so it actually will pull up your your link and Twitter and all
that stuff there's many things you can do so this is really cool stuff to do
with our and eventually I'm going to show you guys how to use git labs and
actually publish straight from our so you're gonna be doing code in fact I
didn't even I didn't I've used this a long time ago but without reading the
instructions I'm gonna show you what this file is I'm gonna give you what's
going on here so first let's go to the files here so let's start let's start up
there in this file setup here it's going to be in that directory that I had so
when I go to my file explorer I can go to file explorer here bring it on over

00:07
and go to documents and I called that site test my first are with Hugo and now
you see all of these different files I'm not gonna play with it here within the
Explorer because it's already down here in my our Studio IDE so under files if
you click on the files tab you'll see the same thing a couple of things to

just click on that if I go back to the main site right here a plain markdown

00:08
pose 2016 hello are marked down so that this right here is this post so when I
click on it you can read this post and it's just an RMD file and I know I've
showed you guys some RMD file some markdown files so let's take a look at
it the only thing that's slightly different actually not even because
you've seen this ya mole code before 1 through 7 if you follow the rest of the

parameter set and then line 10 is just saying hey you know we're going to knit
this using these parameters as well and knitting really this is a default adhere
I didn't you'll probably never change this most likely but now pound our

00:09

linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we

explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the

00:13

if I click on it you get to it and you can hit back I can actually check out my
log post with code this is pretty interesting so you're already there
you've already created a website now Grenda this is locally hosted on your
computer I'm gonna X that out you can also do those things within the viewer

00:06
here as you can see I will actually change me to be a little bit higher I
suppose in fact I wanted me to be this big I think very small I want me to just
be a talking head so we've got that talking head going now this works I mean
within here I can click on about I can click on github and then github is
actually a link so it actually will pull up your your link and Twitter and all
that stuff there's many things you can do so this is really cool stuff to do
with our and eventually I'm going to show you guys how to use git labs and
actually publish straight from our so you're gonna be doing code in fact I
didn't even I didn't I've used this a long time ago but without reading the
instructions I'm gonna show you what this file is I'm gonna give you what's
going on here so first let's go to the files here so let's start let's start up
there in this file setup here it's going to be in that directory that I had so
when I go to my file explorer I can go to file explorer here bring it on over

00:07
and go to documents and I called that site test my first are with Hugo and now
you see all of these different files I'm not gonna play with it here within the
Explorer because it's already down here in my our Studio IDE so under files if
you click on the files tab you'll see the same thing a couple of things to
know you want a config file which is called config dot T om l and t om l is
like you know you've probably heard of ya mol yet another markdown language
it's just another markdown language to have the interpreters interpret these
things as as as they should be right I have an indexed at RM d and if you look
at the title of this actual tab here it's it's actually like a post it's a
hello our markdown right and if we go back to the viewer
just click on that if I go back to the main site right here a plain markdown

00:08
pose 2016 hello are marked down so that this right here is this post so when I
click on it you can read this post and it's just an RMD file and I know I've
showed you guys some RMD file some markdown files so let's take a look at
it the only thing that's slightly different actually not even because
you've seen this ya mole code before 1 through 7 if you follow the rest of the
tutorials I believe that's just animal code it's it's got a title hello our
markdown that's a title of my blog who's the author what's the date categories
you can configure a lot of this stuff elsewhere but we'll get into that in
future tutorials now we have a code chunk what is this code chunk well it's
our because it's backtick backtick backtick r and then it's got a few
parameter set and then line 10 is just saying hey you know we're going to knit
this using these parameters as well and knitting really this is a default adhere
I didn't you'll probably never change this most likely but now pound our

00:09
markdown we saw the that hash tag here that pound what I'm gonna call it it's
got the single header you can read that here you see the our markdown how it's
bigger well it's because it's a header it's got that pound if I change this to
double pound and then I run it know how do I knit I can check that or I could
serve the site we'll get into that later so let's let's forget about changing it
for now but there's way so there's a couple of things I'm gonna show you in
future tutorials when you update I can make it so that you can update this and
you'll have a browser open and as you update it changes it on the browser so
you truly get to know what it looks like in real time right we haven't got that
far yet so I'm gonna keep this all the same for now I'm just describing the
bits and pieces now this is an hour markdown document look at it down here
in the actual thing this is an arm work down document it's nice right and you
even have a link you could see that the link has the brackets and that's just
basically the our markdown syntax so we know it's kind of highlighted there but

00:10
we know that that's a hyperlink because it's got the bracket notation here
anyways you also have the cars data set so not empty cars but just cars my
favorite is empty cars I guess but anyways they didn't they're just calling
us cars so you can name your chunks we haven't talked about that too much but
every chunk can have a name so you can use the name to advantage for different
things you can call chunks from other parts of the code you can recall a chunk
kind of like a function but we didn't get into that either but anyways in this
code we have the summary of cars we have a model oh we've already talked about
linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we
modeling here let's just go and do a little a little backtracking here we
have a linear model we're gonna say hey I want to know if distance can be
explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the
chunk called pi they have a figure caption which is automatically
captioning things and then Tidy equals falls I don't remember what that e what
that means but that's all it is but that's it that's it right there now
let's let's go back to our files here I already gave up on the instructions so I
apologize but I want to kind of give you an idea of what's going on with all
these files because you've created a lot
of files with this one project and so we have the config dot Tamil I believe I

00:12
can edit that here yeah here we go so right here I just clicked on config dot
Tomo T om l and you have all kinds of configuration settings and you can add
more and change things and we're gonna be going into these to make those
changes like these Twitter sites github sites you've change them to your own
then you can add all kinds of different parameters to help help you out logo dot
PNG where is that located we can go find that out as well
so let's get out of the config dot Tomo and I'm going to show you more about
this file structure here so we also have what we have content and we have public
those are the two I want you to focus on
the content is actually where you create the content right if I have a post so
this blog post right here 2015 oh seven twenty three our markdown ARMD you know
that file name is under content let's actually check that out because that's
actually pretty important so let's go to this is not it but documents I think I

00:13
did yeah well site test okay my first our site with you go don't click on that
and I said contents important let's double click on content what do we have
I have about MD but that's not a post you saw the about page but then I have
this post folder so let's go to post now these it's confusing because this isn't
really a post on your website this is a post that we could put on our website
and when we choose to render this and push it to the get lab or the net lift
fee right all these free services that will host websites for free then it'll
be a real post but these are like basically pending posts and what do we
have here we have MD file so a markdown file we have an RMD file and let's
scroll down here we have 2015 oh seven 23 2015 7 23 are marked down to our MD
so the RMD file is what we're dealing with which is located here that's truly
where this file is located it under the our environment that's very important

00:14
now because it's confusing let's go back
to the beginning here and let's click on
public now in public these are different are well not are you should never have
to interact with public don't mess with public until you really know what you're
doing because the are when you render this finally when you generate the site
are will push all of that information to this public folder so when you're all
said and done the only thing that your host needs to see
is the public folder so don't get confused so we had post we have a folder
called post here right and we have this 2015 oh seven twenty-three we have
figures we have all these things we didn't do any of that we didn't do any
of that don't post in public for now do not mess with public just mess with
content the content is what you're messing with so if you if you made a

00:15
mistake you don't want that blog you can delete the RMD file regenerate
everything and then your public folder because you regenerated it the public
folder will be updated so let's say you deleted 25 different posts from your
content folder and you didn't update your site they'll still be there and
it'll confuse you so once you update and generate the site
again it takes care of that you can delete your public folder and regenerate
it all day long as long as you have everything you need in the content
that's all I'm trying to say that's very confusing but I think that's enough to
get started today it doesn't seem like much but it's actually doing a
tremendous amount of things in the background that's gonna help us out I'm
gonna show you to publish these it's gonna be it's gonna be a pretty fun fun
little tutorial so if you want to follow along some more please do and subscribe
like et cetera and comment below if you have any issues I'll try to answer them

00:16
comment below if you have already created one or want to just say hi so I
will see you guys in the next one you [Music]End of file

00:00
welcome back to cradle-to-grave our my name is Mark and I'm gonna show you
today in this series actually I'm going to show you how to create websites use
an R and a theme called Hugo which is written in the NGO language and how to
actually publish these to the websites right for free all of it completely free
the only thing that would cost money is if you wanted your own specific domain
name like cradle-to-grave are calm that would cost you like 12
bucks a year other than that we're gonna create a dynamic static site now I say
that because it's static but it's dynamic because you can update it with
our click a couple buttons and the site has been updated you can also add in
third-party add-ons that'll add like a discuss channel or discuss add-on to
your blogs where people can actually comment so it's a static site
technically but it's gonna be very dynamic in nature so stay tuned what

00:01
what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna take my current our site down completely
from the WordPress site that I have which is I don't I don't want to pay the
money for it anymore and I'm gonna create that site using our
and I'll show you how to do that in this little miniseries I'm gonna put
together we're gonna create some actual websites using our to publish them and
do every all the work we're not going to really just use our though we're gonna
we're going to download a couple of packages we're going to use Hugo as a
theme generator and we're gonna create a static website that's not really static
it's just technically it's static but it's actually dynamic you're gonna
create blogs you're going to be able to update them you're going to be able to
publish them for free using either get labs github or net Liffey and you can
also have your own unique domain name now that part cost so if you own the

00:02
domain name for you know twelve bucks a year you can definitely tie it to net
low fee and get labs if you don't own your own domain name you can still do
this so follow along it's a completely free everything about this is free
except for if you own your own domain name so if you get stuck at any time and
I'm confusing you there's a website called blog down org where I've learned
most of these instructions so I'm just putting it in video format and I'm gonna
add to it as we go but what you want to do is you want to install a package
called blog down first I'm not going to click install because
I've already installed it but when you do that it should take maybe a couple of
minutes depending on your internet connection it's gonna install all the
dependencies everything it needs to get blogged down started now once you do
that there's also another set of tools you'd want to download called dev tools
now if you go to install again if I'm if you're still installing blog down I
recommend pause in this video so that blog down can finish installing so it's

00:03
called dev tools and you can download that just by doing the same thing go to
the package manager packages install and type in dev tools install now the next
thing you want to do after that works you want to use the blog down you just
type in blog down colon colon so that's the name space the scope of this
function I'm gonna use a function called install Hugo as you can see below so it
says install Hugo I've already done that as well that's about as far as I
gotta know so the rest is just basically
new for me so once you do that I'm gonna actually run that and see what it says
so it's gonna install Hugo which is a theme
Hugo is a theme for websites built using the go language you don't have to know
any of that right now you don't have to know anything about HTML nothing you
just literally install it and it does its thing so it's installed Hugo has been
installed that was that that was very simple
luckily blogged down made it easy to install Hugo that's basically what's

00:04
going on here now the best way to learn anything is to actually create the
example right so within just minutes we're gonna create the example file new
project I don't care about saving this one I want to go to a new directory and
I call it a new project you could do now that I have blogged down I could say
website using blog down but let's just go with new project so we could start
from scratch and say hey no we're not gonna do that I'm going to create a in
my documents I will create a new folder called site tests whatever you want to
call it that's where I'm gonna place this new site and this will be my first
our site with Hugo whatever you want to call it anyways
let's create the project and you'll see it's just a blank project like like all
of your projects are when you first start just like this so the next thing
you want to do and this is so simple is you just type in new underscore I'm

00:05
sorry blog down blog down new underscore site boom and now it's gonna generate
everything I need to create a website through our you can see my computer's
pretty fast but you see over here in the viewer I already have a website in fact
I could pop this out I think somehow maybe pop it out boom oh wow when I pop
it out it actually goes to it actually goes to my browser that is default so
that's cool so I'll just keep this up here in this area and show you that look
here these are two blogs this is a link li I'm not sure what that is about page
if I click on it you get to it and you can hit back I can actually check out my
log post with code this is pretty interesting so you're already there
you've already created a website now Grenda this is locally hosted on your
computer I'm gonna X that out you can also do those things within the viewer

00:06
here as you can see I will actually change me to be a little bit higher I
suppose in fact I wanted me to be this big I think very small I want me to just
be a talking head so we've got that talking head going now this works I mean
within here I can click on about I can click on github and then github is

see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the

luckily blogged down made it easy to install Hugo that's basically what's

00:04
going on here now the best way to learn anything is to actually create the
example right so within just minutes we're gonna create the example file new
project I don't care about saving this one I want to go to a new directory and
I call it a new project you could do now that I have blogged down I could say
website using blog down but let's just go with new project so we could start
from scratch and say hey no we're not gonna do that I'm going to create a in
my documents I will create a new folder called site tests whatever you want to
call it that's where I'm gonna place this new site and this will be my first
our site with Hugo whatever you want to call it anyways
let's create the project and you'll see it's just a blank project like like all
of your projects are when you first start just like this so the next thing
you want to do and this is so simple is you just type in new underscore I'm

00:05
sorry blog down blog down new underscore site boom and now it's gonna generate
everything I need to create a website through our you can see my computer's
pretty fast but you see over here in the viewer I already have a website in fact
I could pop this out I think somehow maybe pop it out boom oh wow when I pop
it out it actually goes to it actually goes to my browser that is default so
that's cool so I'll just keep this up here in this area and show you that look
here these are two blogs this is a link li I'm not sure what that is about page
if I click on it you get to it and you can hit back I can actually check out my
log post with code this is pretty interesting so you're already there
you've already created a website now Grenda this is locally hosted on your
computer I'm gonna X that out you can also do those things within the viewer

00:06
here as you can see I will actually change me to be a little bit higher I
suppose in fact I wanted me to be this big I think very small I want me to just
be a talking head so we've got that talking head going now this works I mean
within here I can click on about I can click on github and then github is
actually a link so it actually will pull up your your link and Twitter and all
that stuff there's many things you can do so this is really cool stuff to do
with our and eventually I'm going to show you guys how to use git labs and
actually publish straight from our so you're gonna be doing code in fact I
didn't even I didn't I've used this a long time ago but without reading the
instructions I'm gonna show you what this file is I'm gonna give you what's
going on here so first let's go to the files here so let's start let's start up
there in this file setup here it's going to be in that directory that I had so
when I go to my file explorer I can go to file explorer here bring it on over

00:07
and go to documents and I called that site test my first are with Hugo and now
you see all of these different files I'm not gonna play with it here within the
Explorer because it's already down here in my our Studio IDE so under files if
you click on the files tab you'll see the same thing a couple of things to
know you want a config file which is called config dot T om l and t om l is
like you know you've probably heard of ya mol yet another markdown language
it's just another markdown language to have the interpreters interpret these
things as as as they should be right I have an indexed at RM d and if you look
at the title of this actual tab here it's it's actually like a post it's a
hello our markdown right and if we go back to the viewer
just click on that if I go back to the main site right here a plain markdown

00:08
pose 2016 hello are marked down so that this right here is this post so when I
click on it you can read this post and it's just an RMD file and I know I've
showed you guys some RMD file some markdown files so let's take a look at
it the only thing that's slightly different actually not even because
you've seen this ya mole code before 1 through 7 if you follow the rest of the
tutorials I believe that's just animal code it's it's got a title hello our
markdown that's a title of my blog who's the author what's the date categories
you can configure a lot of this stuff elsewhere but we'll get into that in
future tutorials now we have a code chunk what is this code chunk well it's
our because it's backtick backtick backtick r and then it's got a few
parameter set and then line 10 is just saying hey you know we're going to knit
this using these parameters as well and knitting really this is a default adhere
I didn't you'll probably never change this most likely but now pound our

00:09
markdown we saw the that hash tag here that pound what I'm gonna call it it's
got the single header you can read that here you see the our markdown how it's
bigger well it's because it's a header it's got that pound if I change this to
double pound and then I run it know how do I knit I can check that or I could
serve the site we'll get into that later so let's let's forget about changing it
for now but there's way so there's a couple of things I'm gonna show you in
future tutorials when you update I can make it so that you can update this and
you'll have a browser open and as you update it changes it on the browser so
you truly get to know what it looks like in real time right we haven't got that
far yet so I'm gonna keep this all the same for now I'm just describing the
bits and pieces now this is an hour markdown document look at it down here
in the actual thing this is an arm work down document it's nice right and you
even have a link you could see that the link has the brackets and that's just
basically the our markdown syntax so we know it's kind of highlighted there but

00:10
we know that that's a hyperlink because it's got the bracket notation here
anyways you also have the cars data set so not empty cars but just cars my
favorite is empty cars I guess but anyways they didn't they're just calling
us cars so you can name your chunks we haven't talked about that too much but
every chunk can have a name so you can use the name to advantage for different
things you can call chunks from other parts of the code you can recall a chunk
kind of like a function but we didn't get into that either but anyways in this
code we have the summary of cars we have a model oh we've already talked about
linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we
modeling here let's just go and do a little a little backtracking here we
have a linear model we're gonna say hey I want to know if distance can be
explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the
chunk called pi they have a figure caption which is automatically
captioning things and then Tidy equals falls I don't remember what that e what
that means but that's all it is but that's it that's it right there now
let's let's go back to our files here I already gave up on the instructions so I
apologize but I want to kind of give you an idea of what's going on with all
these files because you've created a lot
of files with this one project and so we have the config dot Tamil I believe I

00:12
can edit that here yeah here we go so right here I just clicked on config dot
Tomo T om l and you have all kinds of configuration settings and you can add
more and change things and we're gonna be going into these to make those
changes like these Twitter sites github sites you've change them to your own
then you can add all kinds of different parameters to help help you out logo dot
PNG where is that located we can go find that out as well
so let's get out of the config dot Tomo and I'm going to show you more about
this file structure here so we also have what we have content and we have public
those are the two I want you to focus on
the content is actually where you create the content right if I have a post so
this blog post right here 2015 oh seven twenty three our markdown ARMD you know
that file name is under content let's actually check that out because that's
actually pretty important so let's go to this is not it but documents I think I

00:13
did yeah well site test okay my first our site with you go don't click on that
and I said contents important let's double click on content what do we have
I have about MD but that's not a post you saw the about page but then I have
this post folder so let's go to post now these it's confusing because this isn't
really a post on your website this is a post that we could put on our website
and when we choose to render this and push it to the get lab or the net lift
fee right all these free services that will host websites for free then it'll
be a real post but these are like basically pending posts and what do we
have here we have MD file so a markdown file we have an RMD file and let's
scroll down here we have 2015 oh seven 23 2015 7 23 are marked down to our MD
so the RMD file is what we're dealing with which is located here that's truly
where this file is located it under the our environment that's very important

00:14
now because it's confusing let's go back
to the beginning here and let's click on
public now in public these are different are well not are you should never have
to interact with public don't mess with public until you really know what you're
doing because the are when you render this finally when you generate the site
are will push all of that information to this public folder so when you're all
said and done the only thing that your host needs to see
is the public folder so don't get confused so we had post we have a folder
called post here right and we have this 2015 oh seven twenty-three we have
figures we have all these things we didn't do any of that we didn't do any
of that don't post in public for now do not mess with public just mess with
content the content is what you're messing with so if you if you made a

00:15
mistake you don't want that blog you can delete the RMD file regenerate
everything and then your public folder because you regenerated it the public
folder will be updated so let's say you deleted 25 different posts from your
content folder and you didn't update your site they'll still be there and
it'll confuse you so once you update and generate the site
again it takes care of that you can delete your public folder and regenerate
it all day long as long as you have everything you need in the content
that's all I'm trying to say that's very confusing but I think that's enough to
get started today it doesn't seem like much but it's actually doing a
tremendous amount of things in the background that's gonna help us out I'm
gonna show you to publish these it's gonna be it's gonna be a pretty fun fun
little tutorial so if you want to follow along some more please do and subscribe
like et cetera and comment below if you have any issues I'll try to answer them

00:16
comment below if you have already created one or want to just say hi so I
will see you guys in the next one you [Music]End of file

00:00
welcome back to cradle-to-grave our my name is Mark and I'm gonna show you
today in this series actually I'm going to show you how to create websites use
an R and a theme called Hugo which is written in the NGO language and how to
actually publish these to the websites right for free all of it completely free
the only thing that would cost money is if you wanted your own specific domain
name like cradle-to-grave are calm that would cost you like 12
bucks a year other than that we're gonna create a dynamic static site now I say
that because it's static but it's dynamic because you can update it with
our click a couple buttons and the site has been updated you can also add in
third-party add-ons that'll add like a discuss channel or discuss add-on to
your blogs where people can actually comment so it's a static site
technically but it's gonna be very dynamic in nature so stay tuned what

00:01
what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna take my current our site down completely
from the WordPress site that I have which is I don't I don't want to pay the
money for it anymore and I'm gonna create that site using our
and I'll show you how to do that in this little miniseries I'm gonna put
together we're gonna create some actual websites using our to publish them and
do every all the work we're not going to really just use our though we're gonna
we're going to download a couple of packages we're going to use Hugo as a
theme generator and we're gonna create a static website that's not really static
it's just technically it's static but it's actually dynamic you're gonna
create blogs you're going to be able to update them you're going to be able to
publish them for free using either get labs github or net Liffey and you can
also have your own unique domain name now that part cost so if you own the

00:02
domain name for you know twelve bucks a year you can definitely tie it to net
low fee and get labs if you don't own your own domain name you can still do
this so follow along it's a completely free everything about this is free
except for if you own your own domain name so if you get stuck at any time and
I'm confusing you there's a website called blog down org where I've learned
most of these instructions so I'm just putting it in video format and I'm gonna
add to it as we go but what you want to do is you want to install a package
called blog down first I'm not going to click install because
I've already installed it but when you do that it should take maybe a couple of
minutes depending on your internet connection it's gonna install all the
dependencies everything it needs to get blogged down started now once you do
that there's also another set of tools you'd want to download called dev tools
now if you go to install again if I'm if you're still installing blog down I
recommend pause in this video so that blog down can finish installing so it's

00:03
called dev tools and you can download that just by doing the same thing go to
the package manager packages install and type in dev tools install now the next
thing you want to do after that works you want to use the blog down you just
type in blog down colon colon so that's the name space the scope of this
function I'm gonna use a function called install Hugo as you can see below so it
says install Hugo I've already done that as well that's about as far as I
gotta know so the rest is just basically
new for me so once you do that I'm gonna actually run that and see what it says
so it's gonna install Hugo which is a theme
Hugo is a theme for websites built using the go language you don't have to know
any of that right now you don't have to know anything about HTML nothing you
just literally install it and it does its thing so it's installed Hugo has been
installed that was that that was very simple
luckily blogged down made it easy to install Hugo that's basically what's

00:04
going on here now the best way to learn anything is to actually create the
example right so within just minutes we're gonna create the example file new

my documents I will create a new folder called site tests whatever you want to
call it that's where I'm gonna place this new site and this will be my first
our site with Hugo whatever you want to call it anyways
let's create the project and you'll see it's just a blank project like like all

see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the

add to it as we go but what you want to do is you want to install a package
called blog down first I'm not going to click install because
I've already installed it but when you do that it should take maybe a couple of
minutes depending on your internet connection it's gonna install all the
dependencies everything it needs to get blogged down started now once you do
that there's also another set of tools you'd want to download called dev tools
now if you go to install again if I'm if you're still installing blog down I
recommend pause in this video so that blog down can finish installing so it's

00:03
called dev tools and you can download that just by doing the same thing go to
the package manager packages install and type in dev tools install now the next
thing you want to do after that works you want to use the blog down you just
type in blog down colon colon so that's the name space the scope of this
function I'm gonna use a function called install Hugo as you can see below so it
says install Hugo I've already done that as well that's about as far as I
gotta know so the rest is just basically
new for me so once you do that I'm gonna actually run that and see what it says
so it's gonna install Hugo which is a theme
Hugo is a theme for websites built using the go language you don't have to know
any of that right now you don't have to know anything about HTML nothing you
just literally install it and it does its thing so it's installed Hugo has been
installed that was that that was very simple
luckily blogged down made it easy to install Hugo that's basically what's

00:04
going on here now the best way to learn anything is to actually create the
example right so within just minutes we're gonna create the example file new
project I don't care about saving this one I want to go to a new directory and
I call it a new project you could do now that I have blogged down I could say
website using blog down but let's just go with new project so we could start
from scratch and say hey no we're not gonna do that I'm going to create a in
my documents I will create a new folder called site tests whatever you want to
call it that's where I'm gonna place this new site and this will be my first
our site with Hugo whatever you want to call it anyways
let's create the project and you'll see it's just a blank project like like all
of your projects are when you first start just like this so the next thing
you want to do and this is so simple is you just type in new underscore I'm

00:05
sorry blog down blog down new underscore site boom and now it's gonna generate
everything I need to create a website through our you can see my computer's
pretty fast but you see over here in the viewer I already have a website in fact
I could pop this out I think somehow maybe pop it out boom oh wow when I pop
it out it actually goes to it actually goes to my browser that is default so
that's cool so I'll just keep this up here in this area and show you that look
here these are two blogs this is a link li I'm not sure what that is about page
if I click on it you get to it and you can hit back I can actually check out my
log post with code this is pretty interesting so you're already there
you've already created a website now Grenda this is locally hosted on your
computer I'm gonna X that out you can also do those things within the viewer

00:06
here as you can see I will actually change me to be a little bit higher I
suppose in fact I wanted me to be this big I think very small I want me to just
be a talking head so we've got that talking head going now this works I mean
within here I can click on about I can click on github and then github is
actually a link so it actually will pull up your your link and Twitter and all
that stuff there's many things you can do so this is really cool stuff to do
with our and eventually I'm going to show you guys how to use git labs and
actually publish straight from our so you're gonna be doing code in fact I
didn't even I didn't I've used this a long time ago but without reading the
instructions I'm gonna show you what this file is I'm gonna give you what's
going on here so first let's go to the files here so let's start let's start up
there in this file setup here it's going to be in that directory that I had so
when I go to my file explorer I can go to file explorer here bring it on over

00:07
and go to documents and I called that site test my first are with Hugo and now
you see all of these different files I'm not gonna play with it here within the
Explorer because it's already down here in my our Studio IDE so under files if
you click on the files tab you'll see the same thing a couple of things to
know you want a config file which is called config dot T om l and t om l is
like you know you've probably heard of ya mol yet another markdown language
it's just another markdown language to have the interpreters interpret these
things as as as they should be right I have an indexed at RM d and if you look
at the title of this actual tab here it's it's actually like a post it's a
hello our markdown right and if we go back to the viewer
just click on that if I go back to the main site right here a plain markdown

00:08
pose 2016 hello are marked down so that this right here is this post so when I
click on it you can read this post and it's just an RMD file and I know I've
showed you guys some RMD file some markdown files so let's take a look at
it the only thing that's slightly different actually not even because
you've seen this ya mole code before 1 through 7 if you follow the rest of the
tutorials I believe that's just animal code it's it's got a title hello our
markdown that's a title of my blog who's the author what's the date categories
you can configure a lot of this stuff elsewhere but we'll get into that in
future tutorials now we have a code chunk what is this code chunk well it's
our because it's backtick backtick backtick r and then it's got a few
parameter set and then line 10 is just saying hey you know we're going to knit
this using these parameters as well and knitting really this is a default adhere
I didn't you'll probably never change this most likely but now pound our

00:09
markdown we saw the that hash tag here that pound what I'm gonna call it it's
got the single header you can read that here you see the our markdown how it's
bigger well it's because it's a header it's got that pound if I change this to
double pound and then I run it know how do I knit I can check that or I could
serve the site we'll get into that later so let's let's forget about changing it
for now but there's way so there's a couple of things I'm gonna show you in
future tutorials when you update I can make it so that you can update this and
you'll have a browser open and as you update it changes it on the browser so
you truly get to know what it looks like in real time right we haven't got that
far yet so I'm gonna keep this all the same for now I'm just describing the
bits and pieces now this is an hour markdown document look at it down here
in the actual thing this is an arm work down document it's nice right and you
even have a link you could see that the link has the brackets and that's just
basically the our markdown syntax so we know it's kind of highlighted there but

00:10
we know that that's a hyperlink because it's got the bracket notation here
anyways you also have the cars data set so not empty cars but just cars my
favorite is empty cars I guess but anyways they didn't they're just calling
us cars so you can name your chunks we haven't talked about that too much but
every chunk can have a name so you can use the name to advantage for different
things you can call chunks from other parts of the code you can recall a chunk
kind of like a function but we didn't get into that either but anyways in this
code we have the summary of cars we have a model oh we've already talked about
linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we
modeling here let's just go and do a little a little backtracking here we
have a linear model we're gonna say hey I want to know if distance can be
explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the
chunk called pi they have a figure caption which is automatically
captioning things and then Tidy equals falls I don't remember what that e what
that means but that's all it is but that's it that's it right there now
let's let's go back to our files here I already gave up on the instructions so I
apologize but I want to kind of give you an idea of what's going on with all
these files because you've created a lot
of files with this one project and so we have the config dot Tamil I believe I

00:12
can edit that here yeah here we go so right here I just clicked on config dot
Tomo T om l and you have all kinds of configuration settings and you can add
more and change things and we're gonna be going into these to make those
changes like these Twitter sites github sites you've change them to your own
then you can add all kinds of different parameters to help help you out logo dot
PNG where is that located we can go find that out as well
so let's get out of the config dot Tomo and I'm going to show you more about
this file structure here so we also have what we have content and we have public
those are the two I want you to focus on
the content is actually where you create the content right if I have a post so
this blog post right here 2015 oh seven twenty three our markdown ARMD you know
that file name is under content let's actually check that out because that's
actually pretty important so let's go to this is not it but documents I think I

00:13
did yeah well site test okay my first our site with you go don't click on that
and I said contents important let's double click on content what do we have
I have about MD but that's not a post you saw the about page but then I have
this post folder so let's go to post now these it's confusing because this isn't
really a post on your website this is a post that we could put on our website
and when we choose to render this and push it to the get lab or the net lift
fee right all these free services that will host websites for free then it'll
be a real post but these are like basically pending posts and what do we
have here we have MD file so a markdown file we have an RMD file and let's
scroll down here we have 2015 oh seven 23 2015 7 23 are marked down to our MD
so the RMD file is what we're dealing with which is located here that's truly
where this file is located it under the our environment that's very important

00:14
now because it's confusing let's go back
to the beginning here and let's click on
public now in public these are different are well not are you should never have
to interact with public don't mess with public until you really know what you're
doing because the are when you render this finally when you generate the site
are will push all of that information to this public folder so when you're all
said and done the only thing that your host needs to see
is the public folder so don't get confused so we had post we have a folder
called post here right and we have this 2015 oh seven twenty-three we have
figures we have all these things we didn't do any of that we didn't do any
of that don't post in public for now do not mess with public just mess with
content the content is what you're messing with so if you if you made a

00:15
mistake you don't want that blog you can delete the RMD file regenerate
everything and then your public folder because you regenerated it the public
folder will be updated so let's say you deleted 25 different posts from your
content folder and you didn't update your site they'll still be there and
it'll confuse you so once you update and generate the site
again it takes care of that you can delete your public folder and regenerate
it all day long as long as you have everything you need in the content
that's all I'm trying to say that's very confusing but I think that's enough to
get started today it doesn't seem like much but it's actually doing a
tremendous amount of things in the background that's gonna help us out I'm
gonna show you to publish these it's gonna be it's gonna be a pretty fun fun
little tutorial so if you want to follow along some more please do and subscribe
like et cetera and comment below if you have any issues I'll try to answer them

00:16
comment below if you have already created one or want to just say hi so I
will see you guys in the next one you [Music]End of file

00:00
welcome back to cradle-to-grave our my name is Mark and I'm gonna show you
today in this series actually I'm going to show you how to create websites use
an R and a theme called Hugo which is written in the NGO language and how to
actually publish these to the websites right for free all of it completely free
the only thing that would cost money is if you wanted your own specific domain
name like cradle-to-grave are calm that would cost you like 12
bucks a year other than that we're gonna create a dynamic static site now I say
that because it's static but it's dynamic because you can update it with
our click a couple buttons and the site has been updated you can also add in
third-party add-ons that'll add like a discuss channel or discuss add-on to
your blogs where people can actually comment so it's a static site
technically but it's gonna be very dynamic in nature so stay tuned what

00:01
what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna take my current our site down completely
from the WordPress site that I have which is I don't I don't want to pay the
money for it anymore and I'm gonna create that site using our
and I'll show you how to do that in this little miniseries I'm gonna put
together we're gonna create some actual websites using our to publish them and
do every all the work we're not going to really just use our though we're gonna
we're going to download a couple of packages we're going to use Hugo as a
theme generator and we're gonna create a static website that's not really static
it's just technically it's static but it's actually dynamic you're gonna
create blogs you're going to be able to update them you're going to be able to
publish them for free using either get labs github or net Liffey and you can
also have your own unique domain name now that part cost so if you own the

00:02
domain name for you know twelve bucks a year you can definitely tie it to net
low fee and get labs if you don't own your own domain name you can still do
this so follow along it's a completely free everything about this is free
except for if you own your own domain name so if you get stuck at any time and
I'm confusing you there's a website called blog down org where I've learned
most of these instructions so I'm just putting it in video format and I'm gonna
add to it as we go but what you want to do is you want to install a package

00:03

the package manager packages install and type in dev tools install now the next

type in blog down colon colon so that's the name space the scope of this

linear models in the statistics model and set of tutorials so what are we

have a linear model we're gonna say hey I want to know if distance can be
explained by the speed right and what's my data I'm gonna bring in cars that you
see here you see the summary where it gives you the summary statistics and
then I would say you can embed our chunk like this give you a summary you have

00:11
your fit and when you call fit it's just giving you the intercept and the speed
right here but it's all in there and then of course they're gonna show a plot
here in a second and I'll show you that as well so included plots you can also
embed plots oh and it's this is kind of cool you have this backslash ref fig PI
so it looks like we can do some sort of like bibliography references and we
should definitely explore that soon right so again it's just more are here
now the only fancy thing that you might not have seen was okay they named the
