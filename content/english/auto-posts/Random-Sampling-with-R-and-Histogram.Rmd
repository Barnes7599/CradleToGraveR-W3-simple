we are going to talk about random number generation and random sampling in this
quick tutorial less than five minutes so bear with me here let's create a bucket
of numbers and inside of this bucket let's put our numbers in we're gonna put
in number one two three four five six randomly a command enter you see the
bucket has been filled with these numbers now let's say we want a sample
out of this bucket and figure out what's in the bucket so let's do a sample
called s1 and I'm gonna use a built-in function called sample and I'm gonna say
well what do I want to sample I want to sample from the bucket how many do I
want to sample I'm gonna take three items from that bucket and replace I
don't I am gonna say replace equals false as in if I pull the number out of
the bucket that is gone is no longer available for my next sample so if I hit
option enter which is just gonna run that line you'll see over here in s1

00:01
that I have a number three one and four notice that there's no repeats let's run
option return or option enter a few times and keep notice of those numbers 2
3 6 5 3 2 that they don't repeat that's because I have replace equals false if I
change this to true and I do option return the very first one is 1 4 4
there's already a repeat so after I pull the first number from the bucket which
was in this case the number 1 I put the number 1 back and I pull another item
from the bucket that's the number 2 happened or the number 4 I happen to get
and then I put the 4 back and the third pole I pulled a 4 and so we repeat it so
let's make this a little bit more fun and create a bucketful of 3 thought or
I'm sorry a sample of 3,000 with replace equals true from this bucket of these
numbers so come and enter on that as you can see there's repeats because I'm
there's no other way to pull 3000 out of a bucket full of 6 so it has to repeat

00:02
and you see that there's tons of numbers they're too much to even put on here so
if I actually type in s1 here you'll see all the numbers here there's tons of
them so how do we make sense of this number these numbers well let's do a quick
histogram H is T and we'll just put in the s-1 there you main enter and the
histogram has been created for us so it's pretty simple
it shows the numbers 1 through 6 and the frequency of times that you've pulled
those numbers from my random sample let's run it a couple times just to see
the bought the bar plot or the histogram I'm sorry change so you see it changed
slightly as I do it so you know that we're getting random numbers okay so
let's say we didn't want a random sample from this bucket but we wanted to do
purely random numbers but we wanted to do a min and Max so instead of using the
bucket I'm gonna go ahead and change this bucket into a a run if statement so
inside of these parentheses I'm gonna put some parameters I wanted to return

00:03
me to 20 numbers 20 numbers that's what I wanted to return and I want the
numbers to be between a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 20 so I'm gonna pull 20
numbers randomly and they're all gonna be between 10 and 20 and what's going to
return is a bucket that contains that and of that bucket I'm gonna sample
3,000 times you'll see this is gonna get a little crazy here
so I hit s1 and and then I'm going to do a histogram of that and we have our
histogram here so it this is very random because the run if I should have done
the run if I could do a random number is equal to run if 20 min equals 10 max
equals 20 here that's whoop what did I do here

00:04
how Arden I'm not found I forgot a little equal sign there so that's fine
and then instead of having the runoff within this first parameter let's just
go ahead and create what are num in there and we have our new histogram and
we can rerun that and our histogram will
change quite quite a lot but what I want to show you is that they are num or
underscore num down here is just a bunch
of random numbers so we created them but they're all between 10 and 20 and they
are all they could be continuous that's a decimal number but so I wanted to show
you that you can pick random ones out of that and the histogram automatically
bins them for us and we'll talk more about that in the next lesson youEnd of file
