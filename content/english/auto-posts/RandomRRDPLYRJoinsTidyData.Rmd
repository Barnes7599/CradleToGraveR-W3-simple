welcome back I wanted to do a quick very quick introduction to how to use the
deployer functions left joint and right joint and there's other joins like inner
join and full join and you can look those up as you need them but today I'm
just going to show you a quick and dirty left and right joins just so you can
have the idea for a future reference so left data I labeled it as left data
and right data I have it here already I'm gonna leave this in the description
so you can just copy and paste it I'm not gonna put the rest of the code in
there but you can copy/paste this so you can duplicate the data what I have is a
left data frame that has six or seven customer IDs and has seven directions
associated with it so the features or the column names of the header if that's
what you're used to calling it will have one column called cust ID and the next
column called area in my right data and I'm just
labeling these left and right just so that we can not lose track of which ones

00:01
which that's also a data frame or a spreadsheet looking thing if you're not
used to data frames yet it has a customer ID column and I risk column but
in the customer ID column we have customers two four and six only and then
the corresponding values would be high high and low if you don't know what rep
means it means repeat repeat high two times repeat low one time and it knows
how to put them there let's just show you the data frames and that'll give you
an idea of what I'm talking about so the left-hand-side data frame looks
like this customer ID one through seven and a bunch of correspondent areas and
the right hand side data looks like this customer ID and risk high high low so
that's all that is that's all that creates once we create those we want to
combine them together somehow let's do what we're gonna do is a left join first
and we simply we would simply type in the left under square join except we
didn't load the library yet so let's load the library that we're going to use
called applier DP Lyr and once you run that you should have no problems and

00:02
using those functions if you don't have to player installed you can install it
by clicking on packages install and just start typing in DP lyr and make sure
install dependencies is there and click on install simple as
now let's do a left join real quick so left underscore join it's so simple and
then you want to put in your X and your Y which is your the X stands for
basically the left-hand spreadsheet and y is the right-hand spreadsheet imagine
you two screens on your computer left and right and you want to join them in
that fashion everything in the left I want to keep but join it with things
that are on the right so left join let's do the left data goes in the left-hand
side of the left join function and then the right data is on the right-hand side
now this won't work as is cuz if I actually run that it's gonna say error
by required because the data sources have no common variables I can fix this
in two ways the first way is not the preferred way but I'll show you anyways

00:03
so instead of customer ID what if we actually just named this trust ID and we
know hey customer ID is the same as customer ID so let's run that real quick
so I reran that and I do left join again and it works and it shows us how the
join works so on the left hand side which was this data I have customers 137
and all these different correspondent areas and of course I have seven here as
well as you can see the risk area some of them are blank so they have na s and
that's because the right hand side did not have a corresponding value for it
but let's pretend that we never change this customer ID because you know what
we got this data from the source and we can't change what the source data is and
we shouldn't because it's we're relying on it from somewhere else in the
organization but we know through our business rules through our logic that
customer ID and our data descriptions that our customer ID is in fact the same
as cust I D so since we know that but the computer doesn't we have to

00:04
explicitly tell it that so again if I run this and this with the new customer
ID feature in there and then I run the left join you are gonna get that same
error so what that what does that mean let's just put a comma and put the by
and we'll say equals and what this is going to equal is a vector I have two
data frames left data and right data on the left hand side we're going to say
custom ID is equal to on the right hand side customer I D just like so now when
I run that it runs well unexpected equal ah because it's a like I said it's a
vector of data here so there we go what did I do wrong
Oh cust ID is missing I do this every time the capital D it slow hasty there
we go and we're back in business so there it is it's love to enjoin and it

00:05
works because we explicitly said hey tie these together by these criteria let's
do a right hand join now so right join and we'll put in the left of data and
the right data again and this time we're doing a we also have to do the buy
because same scenario crust ID equals customer ID you get used to
this pretty quick and put that in quotes and what should be good to go so the
right hand join it only shows us what's
on the right hand side 2 4 &amp; 6 and we
have corresponding high high and low so let's just say number 2 actually didn't
exist in the top 1 so let's just get rid of 2 and we'll get rid of the
corresponding data up for - just to be clear so now we don't have to in the
left of data let's run this again I'm going to the left join and you can see
when I do the left join we have 1 3 4 5

00:06
&amp; 6 we still have the n/a problems and now let's do the right joint show you
the slight difference so now we have a right join that did contain two and it
does have an n/a because two does not exist in the first one because you can
also do things like inner join and again it tells you exactly how to do that we
can do left data right data by equals column of values or a vector of values
customer ID lowercase D equals customer ID by the way I never got an A and my
naming conventions ever so the inner join does not allow for the
NA s because it removes them on both sides if they don't exist on both sides
so it's an overlap in two circles overlapping it's the stuff only in the
middle maybe I'll have a diagram for ya so that's it that's how you do your left
and your right join and I showed you the inner join as well I hope that this

00:07
helps you in your data journey please do me a favor and subscribe hit a little
bell down below help me grow this channel it is very new
I am migrating from one channel to another and I'm making this channel very
very are specific it will have the cradle-to-grave
everything you need to know about are from the ground up and then it'll have
tips and tricks and then I'm gonna throw in things such as everyday use of our
for the business casual user so how to manipulate data how to automate reports
but things that are not really did at sciency but they're very useful in your
business environment so stay tuned subscribe to find out when I publish
these and I will see you on the next one youEnd of file

welcome back I wanted to do a quick very quick introduction to how to use the
deployer functions left joint and right joint and there's other joins like inner
join and full join and you can look those up as you need them but today I'm
just going to show you a quick and dirty left and right joins just so you can
have the idea for a future reference so left data I labeled it as left data
and right data I have it here already I'm gonna leave this in the description
so you can just copy and paste it I'm not gonna put the rest of the code in
there but you can copy/paste this so you can duplicate the data what I have is a
left data frame that has six or seven customer IDs and has seven directions
associated with it so the features or the column names of the header if that's
what you're used to calling it will have one column called cust ID and the next
column called area in my right data and I'm just
labeling these left and right just so that we can not lose track of which ones

00:01
which that's also a data frame or a spreadsheet looking thing if you're not
used to data frames yet it has a customer ID column and I risk column but
in the customer ID column we have customers two four and six only and then
the corresponding values would be high high and low if you don't know what rep
means it means repeat repeat high two times repeat low one time and it knows
how to put them there let's just show you the data frames and that'll give you
an idea of what I'm talking about so the left-hand-side data frame looks
like this customer ID one through seven and a bunch of correspondent areas and
the right hand side data looks like this customer ID and risk high high low so
that's all that is that's all that creates once we create those we want to
combine them together somehow let's do what we're gonna do is a left join first
and we simply we would simply type in the left under square join except we
didn't load the library yet so let's load the library that we're going to use
called applier DP Lyr and once you run that you should have no problems and

00:02
using those functions if you don't have to player installed you can install it
by clicking on packages install and just start typing in DP lyr and make sure
install dependencies is there and click on install simple as
now let's do a left join real quick so left underscore join it's so simple and
then you want to put in your X and your Y which is your the X stands for
basically the left-hand spreadsheet and y is the right-hand spreadsheet imagine
you two screens on your computer left and right and you want to join them in
that fashion everything in the left I want to keep but join it with things
that are on the right so left join let's do the left data goes in the left-hand
side of the left join function and then the right data is on the right-hand side
now this won't work as is cuz if I actually run that it's gonna say error
by required because the data sources have no common variables I can fix this
in two ways the first way is not the preferred way but I'll show you anyways

00:03
so instead of customer ID what if we actually just named this trust ID and we
know hey customer ID is the same as customer ID so let's run that real quick
so I reran that and I do left join again and it works and it shows us how the
join works so on the left hand side which was this data I have customers 137
and all these different correspondent areas and of course I have seven here as
well as you can see the risk area some of them are blank so they have na s and
that's because the right hand side did not have a corresponding value for it
but let's pretend that we never change this customer ID because you know what
we got this data from the source and we can't change what the source data is and
we shouldn't because it's we're relying on it from somewhere else in the
organization but we know through our business rules through our logic that
customer ID and our data descriptions that our customer ID is in fact the same
as cust I D so since we know that but the computer doesn't we have to

00:04
explicitly tell it that so again if I run this and this with the new customer
ID feature in there and then I run the left join you are gonna get that same
error so what that what does that mean let's just put a comma and put the by
and we'll say equals and what this is going to equal is a vector I have two
data frames left data and right data on the left hand side we're going to say
custom ID is equal to on the right hand side customer I D just like so now when
I run that it runs well unexpected equal ah because it's a like I said it's a
vector of data here so there we go what did I do wrong
Oh cust ID is missing I do this every time the capital D it slow hasty there
we go and we're back in business so there it is it's love to enjoin and it

00:05
works because we explicitly said hey tie these together by these criteria let's
do a right hand join now so right join and we'll put in the left of data and
the right data again and this time we're doing a we also have to do the buy
because same scenario crust ID equals customer ID you get used to
this pretty quick and put that in quotes and what should be good to go so the
right hand join it only shows us what's
on the right hand side 2 4 &amp; 6 and we
have corresponding high high and low so let's just say number 2 actually didn't
exist in the top 1 so let's just get rid of 2 and we'll get rid of the
corresponding data up for - just to be clear so now we don't have to in the
left of data let's run this again I'm going to the left join and you can see
when I do the left join we have 1 3 4 5

00:06
&amp; 6 we still have the n/a problems and now let's do the right joint show you
the slight difference so now we have a right join that did contain two and it
does have an n/a because two does not exist in the first one because you can
also do things like inner join and again it tells you exactly how to do that we
can do left data right data by equals column of values or a vector of values
customer ID lowercase D equals customer ID by the way I never got an A and my
naming conventions ever so the inner join does not allow for the
NA s because it removes them on both sides if they don't exist on both sides
so it's an overlap in two circles overlapping it's the stuff only in the
middle maybe I'll have a diagram for ya so that's it that's how you do your left
and your right join and I showed you the inner join as well I hope that this

00:07
helps you in your data journey please do me a favor and subscribe hit a little
bell down below help me grow this channel it is very new
I am migrating from one channel to another and I'm making this channel very
very are specific it will have the cradle-to-grave

welcome back I wanted to do a quick very quick introduction to how to use the
deployer functions left joint and right joint and there's other joins like inner
join and full join and you can look those up as you need them but today I'm
just going to show you a quick and dirty left and right joins just so you can
have the idea for a future reference so left data I labeled it as left data
and right data I have it here already I'm gonna leave this in the description
so you can just copy and paste it I'm not gonna put the rest of the code in
there but you can copy/paste this so you can duplicate the data what I have is a
left data frame that has six or seven customer IDs and has seven directions
associated with it so the features or the column names of the header if that's
what you're used to calling it will have one column called cust ID and the next
column called area in my right data and I'm just
labeling these left and right just so that we can not lose track of which ones

00:01
which that's also a data frame or a spreadsheet looking thing if you're not
used to data frames yet it has a customer ID column and I risk column but
in the customer ID column we have customers two four and six only and then
the corresponding values would be high high and low if you don't know what rep
means it means repeat repeat high two times repeat low one time and it knows
how to put them there let's just show you the data frames and that'll give you
an idea of what I'm talking about so the left-hand-side data frame looks
like this customer ID one through seven and a bunch of correspondent areas and
the right hand side data looks like this customer ID and risk high high low so
that's all that is that's all that creates once we create those we want to
combine them together somehow let's do what we're gonna do is a left join first
and we simply we would simply type in the left under square join except we
didn't load the library yet so let's load the library that we're going to use
called applier DP Lyr and once you run that you should have no problems and

00:02
using those functions if you don't have to player installed you can install it
by clicking on packages install and just start typing in DP lyr and make sure
install dependencies is there and click on install simple as
now let's do a left join real quick so left underscore join it's so simple and
then you want to put in your X and your Y which is your the X stands for
basically the left-hand spreadsheet and y is the right-hand spreadsheet imagine
you two screens on your computer left and right and you want to join them in
that fashion everything in the left I want to keep but join it with things
that are on the right so left join let's do the left data goes in the left-hand
side of the left join function and then the right data is on the right-hand side
now this won't work as is cuz if I actually run that it's gonna say error
by required because the data sources have no common variables I can fix this
in two ways the first way is not the preferred way but I'll show you anyways

00:03
so instead of customer ID what if we actually just named this trust ID and we
know hey customer ID is the same as customer ID so let's run that real quick
so I reran that and I do left join again and it works and it shows us how the
join works so on the left hand side which was this data I have customers 137
and all these different correspondent areas and of course I have seven here as
well as you can see the risk area some of them are blank so they have na s and
that's because the right hand side did not have a corresponding value for it
but let's pretend that we never change this customer ID because you know what
we got this data from the source and we can't change what the source data is and
we shouldn't because it's we're relying on it from somewhere else in the
organization but we know through our business rules through our logic that
customer ID and our data descriptions that our customer ID is in fact the same
as cust I D so since we know that but the computer doesn't we have to

00:04
explicitly tell it that so again if I run this and this with the new customer
ID feature in there and then I run the left join you are gonna get that same
error so what that what does that mean let's just put a comma and put the by
and we'll say equals and what this is going to equal is a vector I have two
data frames left data and right data on the left hand side we're going to say
custom ID is equal to on the right hand side customer I D just like so now when
I run that it runs well unexpected equal ah because it's a like I said it's a
vector of data here so there we go what did I do wrong
Oh cust ID is missing I do this every time the capital D it slow hasty there
we go and we're back in business so there it is it's love to enjoin and it

00:05
works because we explicitly said hey tie these together by these criteria let's
do a right hand join now so right join and we'll put in the left of data and
the right data again and this time we're doing a we also have to do the buy
because same scenario crust ID equals customer ID you get used to
this pretty quick and put that in quotes and what should be good to go so the
right hand join it only shows us what's
on the right hand side 2 4 &amp; 6 and we
have corresponding high high and low so let's just say number 2 actually didn't
exist in the top 1 so let's just get rid of 2 and we'll get rid of the
corresponding data up for - just to be clear so now we don't have to in the
left of data let's run this again I'm going to the left join and you can see
when I do the left join we have 1 3 4 5

00:06
&amp; 6 we still have the n/a problems and now let's do the right joint show you
the slight difference so now we have a right join that did contain two and it
does have an n/a because two does not exist in the first one because you can
also do things like inner join and again it tells you exactly how to do that we
can do left data right data by equals column of values or a vector of values
customer ID lowercase D equals customer ID by the way I never got an A and my
naming conventions ever so the inner join does not allow for the
NA s because it removes them on both sides if they don't exist on both sides
so it's an overlap in two circles overlapping it's the stuff only in the
middle maybe I'll have a diagram for ya so that's it that's how you do your left
and your right join and I showed you the inner join as well I hope that this
