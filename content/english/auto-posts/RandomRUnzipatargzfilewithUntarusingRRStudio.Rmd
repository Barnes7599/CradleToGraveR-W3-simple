in this video I'm gonna show you how to use our in our studio to unzip a tar.gz
file if you haven't seen one you probably will I'm gonna pull it up here
and show you that I have two of these files one is 2.8 gig and one is just
very tiny I had to download all of my wordpress and all of my website stuff
because again I'm migrating it from one host to another
I'm migrating it to a free host that being said let's just play around with
this example file here I don't even know what this is I downloaded it from the
internet so that tar.gz at the very end is what we're
dealing with right so how do we do this with our so that's me the website is
mark gin grass calm and cradle-to-grave are calm I trying hard to minimize my

00:01
post-production editing so I'm putting the intros as you just saw it at least
that's the idea okay anyways that being said let's get right to it this takes
just a few moments we are gonna create a variable we don't have to but it's just
gonna make it a little cleaner called file name and set it equal to the actual
file so for me I have it under this downloads section here where when you
click on the path in the address bar it doesn't give you the full path it's
giving you like the shortcut and drives me insane so I'm not sure how to get
that path except for if I right-click on the file itself and go to properties I
can get the location here so C Drive users mark G backslash downloads so I'm
going to do control C on that and then let's get back to my R and do control
well let's put it in quotes control V here but don't forget the back slashes
don't really work in R because it's an escape character so I'm gonna use a
forward slash instead you could also use double backslash that would also work

00:02
and it's not really this isn't the file name that's the file location so I'm
going to add another backslash and let's grab that name as well it's way too
complicated for me to remember so I'm just gonna copy that
boom control C bring it back and add it right here control V there we
have it we have our filename let's just go ahead and load that into memory
control enter on that you could see in the top right my file name has been
chosen now this is how simple this is gonna be we are literally just gonna do
untarnishable have to download any packages on thar and then just type in
your file name and you can actually do I think it's list list equals true and
that will actually list all of the file files contained within that so let's do
that first alright and that's also a good test to see if it actually picked
it up correctly so you should see down in my console a list of all these files
now it's not really unzipped yet and oh one more thing

00:03
where is this gonna put when I unzip it where's it gonna go right so we got to
figure that out so let's just do a couple uh a couple of examples here
we'll just do untarnished it goes true and see where it goes I'm in this
downloads folder here I'm referring to the Downloads folder but but it's not
gonna go there so I don't think anyway it's gonna do ctrl enter see if that
works instantaneously down here at the bottom
it seems to be done but where did it go let's see downloads it's not there so
let's figure out where we're at within this project if we do get WD get working
directory then you can see I'm working in the C Drive colon uses mark G
documents so that's where it must have unzipped it so let's go to the documents
which is right here and that file name was called phase G oh so it created this
folder you can see it's 7:27 p.m. and if you can see in the bottom of my screen

00:04
at 7:28 p.m. what is this ah you know what pop-ups during a recording that's
free advertisement they should give me some money for that anyways we are back
at it and that's where it went it went here if you double click on it you can
see that all of these different files are in there and I don't know what they
are I just downloaded this off the internet but that's how you do it
because if you try to go to let's go back to my downloads if I you know you
can see that my marks Windows does not understand what this
file is so without download third-party apps turns out you already have a third
pretty app that can do it called our studio
it's very nifty very handy and I believe
you can also set the directories as well
we could try that real quick while we're here
file name comma and we can add an X I think e ex dir yes so I don't know what
that stands for but you know the directory that we're going to put it in

00:05
we can put it in the same directory if we chose and I believe if the directory
is not present it'll create it so let's just call this temp tar.gz file right
let's see if this works I'm not I'm not sure I got no error so that's good now
let's go back to the downloads you can see temperature GZ boom it did it for us
so you can you can definitely do it that way as well
that being said this is a practical use of our studio it's not statistics it's
nothing crazy programming but it's practical if you had a directory full of
tar.gz files we can loop this and you can undo the entire directory at the
same time so if you find these useful again share like and thanks everybody
that's been subscribing left and right I really appreciate it and I will put out
some more videos soon youEnd of file
