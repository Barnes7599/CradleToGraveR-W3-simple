now the day another tutorial let’s get this started we are in the our studio
environment and I am going to show you the here package and how to organize
some files and projects I think it’s about time we start cleaning up the way
we set up our projects and doing it the correct way so that being said let’s
create a brand new project which will start us fresh by doing if I could find
my mouse file new project and let’s just jump in new directory new our project
and call it whatever you want remember the path that you put it in so be my
here project sure right you could browse
and figure out where you’re gonna put it that’d be nice so mines under documents
and this PC so just just so I know we’re going to find it create that project</p>
<p>00:01
it’s an empty project it’ll be nothing there except for my actual project so
documents so in the documents of course to get there and to go through this PC
local disk users Marjorie documents I hate not having full paths in this
address bar or drives me insane but I can go to my my here project right here
double click on it and you’ll see I just have my here project that’s it dot our
project our project okay so that keep that in mind now
what’s our working directory we just created a project
so what automatically happens is the working directory changes to the project
directory so we get WD in the console command enter or just control enter or
plain old enter because we’re in the console you can see the entire path of
where the projects located that’s fine and dandy what we want to do is organize
our files and make sure we do it the correct way to a point so let’s not put</p>
<p>00:02
a lot of things inside of this particular path let’s do a new folder
and create we’ll create a couple folks here data create a new folder called
scripts this is where the scripts would lie you might have 2030 scripts in there
for now a new folder figures so any pictures
or things you want to use - for reports for some reason you want to save them
let’s do that under data let’s go ahead and create another subfolder and we’ll
call that raw data and that’s probably good for now for these small projects
we’ll keep it simple so we’re gonna do a
new file I’m going to create an R script and now that we have the script open
here let’s just do a ctrl s and save it and let’s put it in the right place
we’re gonna put it under scripts so it’s saved we’ll call this first my first
script cool got that figured out now let’s play with a couple examples and</p>
<p>00:03
work with what we have here what we got going on let’s start with my favorite my
favorite data set empty cars I’m sorry you’ve probably so sick of me saying
that okay there it is empty cars has been loaded into my
environment I have it it’s here but it’s
not really stored anywhere except for in RAM right now it’s in my RAM but it’s
not saved on to the disk the file system
we can do that we can use write CSV I do write
CSV I have all these options I hit tab see x equals file equals and all that
stuff so let’s just do I believe we just do I want to bring in my data to write
just HV and I want to save it to a file named let’s call it a la dot CSV that’s
all there is to it control-enter on that now where did it save it to let’s check
it out let’s go to our directories we have it right here in our base path the</p>
<p>00:04
blood at CSV you see it right there it’s saved I don’t have Excel or anything on
this computer so I can’t really open it up without I could open up with notepad
if I want to but you all know what a CSV file as I would hope by now so we have
this bit didn’t go into the data you know it didn’t do anything
let’s let’s delete that and try something new delete gone let’s do /data /index
control-enter on that era ah no such file or directory oh let’s get rid of
that /a control-enter there it is I’m actually messing with you a little bit
so hold on one second data there’s our blah now it’s in the
raw folder so delete that again we screwed up data slash raw slash blah now</p>
<p>00:05
we go back and it’s in the right place right there boom I’m gonna delete it
anyways bye okay we’re back right down CSP not bad not bad
we’re gonna do this a different way though cuz we don’t want to deal with
did I put a forward slash here didn’t do I do any back slashes forward slashes I
don’t want to mess with all that so let’s do install packages install I’m
gonna type in here and it should populate and just hit tab and click on
install as always mine’s already installed so I’m gonna cancel that let’s
load that library called here at the top and be right here get it I’m just
kidding okay here and then as soon as you load
it it says starts at C Drive blah blah blah my here projects all fine and dandy
what we’re gonna do with this package is it we’re gonna get rid of all this so
cuz we don’t want to deal with forward slashes of back slashes what file system
we on Linux that we on Mac going on PC Windows like what are we on so let’s</p>
<p>00:06
forget about all that so let’s just do write dot CSV and this time we’re just
gonna say here I’m gonna write here and where am I going to put it in quotes I’m
gonna say I want to put this into data the raw data and I’m gonna call it my
data dot CSV coming in or ctrl enter as you can tell I cannot switch between a
PC and a Mac very easily with my shortcuts let’s see if it actually
loaded and it did what did I do oh I have to bring the
data my data now we’re good it’s always the little things there it
is my data that’s his fee and you can see it’s under my here projects data row
so that did the trick pretty cool now we don’t overwrite empty
cars we don’t want to do anything that’s why we always store it as a as my data
we can break my data all day long start a fresh new on and create and then</p>
<p>00:07
reassign it to empty cars but the idea is sometimes you might have your own
data or data that you want to really have to be persistent you would save it
in that raw data and you can always refer back to that raw data to load it
in fact we can do that instead of an empty cars now we have that file we can
actually say read CSV and right here you can just say here open French see now
where is that data we want data raw and it was called my data
CSV so before I hit enter let’s go ahead
and remove this gone and I don’t need to write this data anymore because it’s
written and you can keep this if you want I’ll just put it in a comment so we
have nothing loaded into our environment let’s do ctrl enter and lo and behold
it’s 32 observations and twelve variables it did the trick and it did it
without any forward slashes of back slashes congratulations now let’s just</p>
<p>00:08
quickly do one more thing to make this a little bit cooler for us let’s create a
ggplot so let’s add our library up top ggplot2 and let’s go through just great
one real quick we will call it ggplot aesthetic well let’s not forget our data
I want to bring in my data aesthetic x equals weights y equals
drat that one yeah and we want to create a scatterplot because that’s the best
way to look at data quickly and efficiently so she um went and that’s it
oh my data created the plot you can see it right here I just created that plot
and now let’s save it so we’re gonna save this by doing GG sick doo doo doo</p>
<p>00:09
save it’ll save your last plot that you created where do we want to save it
though save it here not here though in figures figures and what do I want to
call it I want to call it my my data plot dot PNG right control-enter on that
could not find juju salve let’s do save instead and go from there Oh save the
image and six point three by five point seven nine inches let’s take a look at
it so if we go back to my here project and I go to figures and there it is PNG
you could post this on Facebook and when you do don’t forget to link this video
and get other people to watch my videos sorry this was a little long-winded but
I think it’s important that you learn how to save and create these directories
and keep that structure going so that it’s nice and organized so you you’ve
learned how to use the here package a little bit and how to save a tree tree</p>
<p>00:10
plot as a PNG file you can also save it as other other formats and there’s a few
of them I don’t know them all I don’t have them all memorized but PDF works
let’s take a quick look at that under figures so whatever you want to do with
it I actually don’t think I have Adobe PDF loaded we’ll see it’ll probably open
up in chrome Brin it’s not a brand new PC it’s a temporary workaround for my
set up there we go it’s a PDF file so take a look play around with it save
your stuff and then now that you saved it posted on Twitter Facebook and don’t
forget to tag me in there appreciate you
guys thanks for everything and as always I’ll see you in the next video [Music]End of file</p>
