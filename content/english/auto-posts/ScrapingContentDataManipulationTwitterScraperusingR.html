hi I’m margin grass my last video I showed you how to interface with the
Twitter API use an R and scrapin tweets based on your search results advise you
to step back and watch that video if you haven’t you might be a little bit
lost during this video we’re gonna talk about scraping cleaning the data and
using some analysis techniques and creating a word cloud again go back to
the previous video if you haven’t created your Twitter API account that’s
free to get these access tokens and these API secret keys don’t forget that
these keys are not public so keep those to yourself that’s why mine are all X
Doe okay so for all you users out there that are still following along added a
couple libraries the TM text manipulation the word cloud and the p ly
r and r color brewer let’s go down run those libraries run</p>
<p>00:01
your API keys and set a good Twitter authorization I’ve already done those
steps now we’re gonna collect I’m gonna put down the first three thousand tweets
I’m gonna collect those in the tweets underscore Trump it’s a search Twitter
object that’s being returned I don’t really know a lot about that object so
what I want to do after I’ve collected these tweets is convert them to a data
frame something that we are way more familiar with now this might take a few
minutes maybe a minute or two to actually happen so I’m gonna continue
talking while it’s gathering those tweets so on line 21 is where we are
next it’s going to convert based on this function here my search Twitter object
into a data frame and once that happens I’m gonna explain to you I’m gonna show
you the data frame oh it’s already up so let’s do it so I’m gonna convert the
data frame now so I can show it to you and that shouldn’t take nearly as long</p>
<p>00:02
as scraping those tweets and my next line 22 what I am actually doing is I’m
telling it the data frame to get rid of all the columns except for the first one
because I’m only interested in that first one so all rows comma first column
is what I’m going to set it to why let’s take a look so I clicked on tweets text
and you see all these different columns here most of these columns are not
really useful to me they might be useful
to you so you might want to keep them or do something with them but I’m
interested in jazz this text one right here the very first column so I’m gonna
go ahead and just go ahead and delete the rest and that’s what line 22 does so
let’s run that and you can go back to tweets texts oh now it’s a now it’s a
vector based on a single column so you can’t click on it in the View mode so
we’re down to one column that text column now we have to create a corpus a</p>
<p>00:03
corpus is a collection of articles you can have a collection of articles about
Trump a collection of articles about Clinton a collection of articles about
skateboard doesn’t matter that’s what a corpus is a collection of articles
usually probably a large collection multiple collections of articles
multiple numbers of corpus is a core by just so you know so let’s create that
corpus object on line 25 I will run that and it’s also it’s not looking directly
for what where the corpus is or what text encompasses that corpus it’s
actually looking for the source of that corpus so you have different parameters
you can put in the source right here so it says vector source my source is that
tweets dot text data frame now the vector source can change that’s why it’s
a dynamic source so therefore that’s what the corpus function is asking for
the actual source not the actual text itself so anyways we created the tweet
corpus now there’s a couple of helper functions that I’ve created and googled</p>
<p>00:04
a lot of to try to get these to work there’s quite a quite a few things to
Google out there that’ll help you with this if you can’t figure it out these
two sites will get you in the right path but I wanted to remove URLs I wanted to
remove the anywhere where it said at and
then the username I wanted to get rid of that get rid of emojis and get rid of
special characters before I do anything with the text it just makes things
easier now these are all functions so I’m gonna go ahead and load these into
memory but they’d actually do anything yet except
to load these into memory so those functions can be called any time and
that’s what I’m about to do here so this very first call I’m gonna do is on line
35 tweet corpus equals text manipulation map and then you bring it in the tweet
corpus and you are using what they call a Content transformer function
I believe that’s just a way to validate that the functions gonna work for this
TM map it’s nothing special just plug in your function here where tweet dot</p>
<p>00:05
remove URL is and it’ll go ahead and run that function on all of your articles
basically our articles are individual tweets
so let’s go ahead and click enter on that and then I want to inspect the
first floor and let’s see what it looks like so here we are down here in my
console area my number one is it says at super dupe blah blah blah blah blah all
this stuff typically I don’t want to keep things like after the at but
sometimes you will lose relevant information like at then somebody’s name
that’s famous that might count but if it’s at somebody’s name that you don’t
know some of these friend of a friend that’s why for me I just get rid of them
all and I hope the best for that so the next one is removed the user the at and
the user let’s inspect again and see now
you see I don’t have any at symbols with a user name in here so that’s gone the
very next line on line 39 remove emojis because those will cause you some
headaches if you don’t remove special characters same deal strip the</p>
<p>00:06
whitespace if I have two spaces or three spaces or an enter I don’t want it so
let’s remove that we’re gonna do it an analysis on this text and you know is it
is it fair to do an analysis on one word space versus a one word no space or
hello I’m versus hello space base I’m things like that so remove the white
space let’s get rid of that type of problem and then we’re gonna remove the
punctuation and we’re gonna make it all lowercase and the next one here is
called a stop word and you get to plug in your language of choice as a list of
them but language is English and what stop words are the simple words like
and a the these those don’t really mean anything for a statistical analysis I
mean those words are everywhere so I want to get rid of them let’s not
count them at all but I also added a couple other words in here like capital
RT cuz retweet is always in there and RT
is always in there and I know that ahead of time so I don’t want those to be in</p>
<p>00:07
my my corpus real Donald Trump I put in there but the at function to remove the
@ should take care of that anyways they’re just in case I threw it in there
as well so it’s going to hit enter on that one and remove numbers okay so I’m
gonna go ahead and inspect again I’m gonna go back up to 38 and run that just
to show you like what this now looks like and I know there’s spaces in there
you can run the space one again maybe in fact let’s let’s see if it actually
works this go to line 41 okay enter and then let’s go back to
inspect and see if it okay so spaces were added because I
removed a bunch of words afterwards so maybe we’ll add that line
let’s see lying strip whitespace well let’s just go ahead and do that at the
very end so let’s let’s cancel that one out and plug it in way down here and now
we can only have to use it once so here’s what it looks like super dope
keeps promises will still you know a lot of it doesn’t make sense but we’re</p>
<p>00:08
looking at frequency of words how long they show up how many on how often they
show up okay so we strip the whitespace going down we’re going to now use this
thing called a term document matrix and we’re gonna bring in our corpus the one
that we just cleaned up there was this one here that’s three thousand rows long
we’re gonna we’re gonna use term document matrix and what that’s gonna do
it’s gonna take all three thousand articles it’s gonna check for all the
frequency of all the words and see which word is in which article and it’s a
pretty handy in fact I’ll show you what it looks like in just a second here so
let’s run that and then we’re gonna run the next one because we can’t really see
the term document matrix in our viewer for our studio but we can see an actual
matrix in the viewer so let’s run line 55 and so our AP dot M should be in the
viewer and now like I said it’s 3,000 articles and all the words that are in
there it’s gonna be a pretty large matrix okay</p>
<p>00:09
so you see the words going down the left-hand side I am not sure why I
wanted to remissed sin but anyways they’re going down the left-hand side
and you have down here it tells you four
thousand ninety two different words that
showed up in three thousand articles and the articles are displayed going across
the columns now our studio has a limitation of display and 100 our
columns there actually are three thousand columns own I’m going to show
you that in a second so these number ones here should say hey the word
promise shows up an article usually these are lined up I’m not sure whether
or not but I’m guessing that’s article 3 or 4 so the word promises should be an
article 3 or 4 let’s close this out and take a look at it because we did the
inspect or we can do it again we can do type in the console inspect and then
let’s put our corpus in there which was tweet corpus and let’s put it in line 3
and just see what it looks like I don’t see the word promise in there yeah the</p>
<p>00:10
fact that it was not lined up scares me a little bit but let’s just see if it’s
somewhere in there so I typed in 2 and it shows key promises
something’s not aligned up but that’s not going to bother us for what we’re
doing ok so we’ve created the tournament
document matrix we’ve created the matrix itself that we can view and use and
manipulate let’s show the dimensions of that matrix because I showed you it was
only a hundred columns in the our studio viewer but if you do the dimensions
which is line 56 it shows 4,000 92 by 3000 okay then we’re gonna sort these by
some of those rows so that we can kind of get which words show up the most and
that’s what line 57 does line 58 is going to create a data frame and let’s
take a look at that data frame APD that data frame has taken the highest
frequency words and it’s showing us basically the frequency count per word</p>
<p>00:11
okay so the next part I create this pal - I didn’t actually create I got it from
the exact example from this web site here and there’s a bunch of other
examples too so when you do that it’s going to create like a color palette
that way it’ll reflect multiple colors when you use this word cloud read up on
it from line 60 website now this PNG it’s gonna create a PNG file which is
like a photo or an image file everyone should be familiar with that because
JPEG but usually no background so I’m gonna run that one and you can change
those dimensions to whatever you want if
you want a smaller a bigger and then I’m gonna run the word cloud and then I’m
gonna say dev off and dev off is basically just saying hey this PNG file
alright everything that you’ve displayed that’s all I want I’m done I’m done
grabbing it ok so learning this word cloud function
here you have different parameters you can use go ahead and research more on
word cloud play with what I have here and see if you can manipulate it the way</p>
<p>00:12
you want but these parameters are you can easily look those up so if you go to
real Donald Trump PNG file that it just created in your working directory if you
don’t know your working directory you just type in get WD it should be in your
working directory and mine is called real Donald Trump let’s take a look at
it and see if it worked out good there we go so there’s my word cloud just
created that there’s look minor errors that we had we could clean up a little
bit and I’m curious to see what kind of word clouds you come up with so I feel
free to post links or post on the blog or comment on the YouTube videos hope
this video helped sorry it was pretty fast and a little chaotic but good luck
on your word cloudEnd of file</p>
