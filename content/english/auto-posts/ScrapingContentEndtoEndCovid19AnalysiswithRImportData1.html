all right we’re gonna get right to the point there’s been a lot of cases of
coronavirus or Kovac 19 since last December up to over 100,000 cases us
being our users and our programmers let’s go ahead and start a project where
we can start analyzing some of this data so throughout the next couple tutorials
I’m gonna show you how to import the data daily we’re gonna modify the code
as we go but each tutorial is meant to be very short under five or six minutes
and we’ll go from importing the data to fully on predicting where this possible
virus is going to go in the future so that being said we have a website here
called the European center for disease prevention and control luckily for us
the European CD PC offers this data for free the United States CDC does not
offer this data for free anymore I believe it’s a political thing anyways
if you scroll down on this website which</p>
<p>00:01
I’ll leave for you you’ll see a download today’s data if you click on that it’s
an excel file and this file looks like this it’s got the date recorded the
country of exposure the new confirmed cases and the new deaths and then
columns enf I’m not quite sure what that means I didn’t read the data data
description which you should do we can find out on the website I’m sure okay
notice another thing that there’s only two tabs here and it’s a csv underscore
four underscore comms and sheet one which is the typical excel file sheet
one all right so that’s not that important yet but note that if there’s
multiple tabs we have to be specific on which tab we want to import let’s go
back to our I want to show you a couple things first let’s go ahead and do a new
project file a new project we will do a new directory new project we’re gonna
call this Kovac case whatever you want to name it what about my desktop create</p>
<p>00:02
the project once that’s created let’s go ahead and create a our notebook so we
can add some narrate narrative to it as we need it so a new file our notebook
and here we go we don’t need all of this stuff delete we can keep the title and
the yamo code up the top let’s call this covert cases and are whatever you want
to call it okay now let’s go down so lines one through four that’s just some
metadata that’s used to create the HTML file that this will produce at the end
of the day all right so we want to first put a little narrative in there let’s
just do a hash tag which makes a header so we’re gonna say Kovach data import
and I’m making this very simples to keep this tutorial very short obviously you</p>
<p>00:03
want to add as much information as you’d like so we can say this is where we get
the data something like that now for this I’m gonna actually put the
main site here which is right here command C let’s just drop that in right
now this is just not part of my code a part of our narrative so how do we
insert a our chunk so we can start doing some actual our I believe it’s alt ctrl
I it’s been a minute all right so I inserted a chunk here so you can
actually take these out for anybody that’s new these are not the ’ it’s not
the pinky finger on your keyboard your QWERTY keyboard it is actually the key
to the left of the number one so it’s called the backtick that’ll confuse you
if you didn’t know that because they look very similar all right so we have
the are there let’s go ahead and install a couple packages that you will
definitely need for this so first I want you to click on packages go to install</p>
<p>00:04
let’s do H TTT R and we’re going to install that one mine’s already
installed so I’m not gonna install it again so the next package is read Excel
and then you click on install same thing it’ll reach out to the crammed library
and install it for you so once you have those installed we can use those
libraries so let’s go ahead and load them make sure your installed hhd are
library read Excel I’m gonna head and run both these chunks by in this little
play button here I got the green light nothing no errors so we’re good to go
totally cool the h TT d r HT t TR will help us navigate some of the URLs that
we’re going to need and the reed XL will do the reading of the excel file let’s
start with name in that URL that we need so we’ll just call it URL 1 and I’m</p>
<p>00:05
gonna I’m gonna assign it to some sort of string and that string is going to be
the actual URL of this excel file so I’m
going to right click on it click on copy link address and we’re gonna go back
over here and I’m going to paste it right in there command V and in this
tutorial we’re gonna leave it as is to keep this short but notice the date it’s
220 2003 0 8 we know well we’re gonna assume that
tomorrow 3 9 it’s gonna change to 3 9 so that’s something that we have to figure
out how to programmatically do in the next tutorial but for now let’s just use
this and get the basics we’re going so we’ve got the URL I’ll go ahead and
command enter on this line 14 you’ll see it’s in my global environment now cool
simple as that now what we want to do we’re gonna use a
get function the get function is from HTTP our and what we’re gonna do is
we’re gonna say hey I want euro one that I just loaded into memory I’m gonna</p>
<p>00:06
write to the desk so write underscore the desk now you don’t really have to
memorize this you can just kind of copy it cuz you don’t use it that often I
want to create a temp file and I’m gonna call it well I’m gonna tell it what the
extension is gonna be with dot XLS I know that’s to be true and what’s that
what is that going to do it’s gonna call
this URL right here and it’s gonna write
a temporary file to disk because I don’t really want to save this every time I
want to save my our output but I don’t really want to save the temporary file
you can save it as an output as well but so let’s go ahead and run line 17 to
make sure it works command enter and we’ve got no problems with that
you’ll see TF is up here we have TF and we have a URL now what are we gonna do
with that we’re going to read that temporary file into memory so let’s go
ahead and do my data frame Cova data frame is going to be equal to read</p>
<p>00:07
underscore Excel and I want TF yeah just like that that should do the trick
command enter on that you’ll see DF up here has 45 or 4528 observations of six
variables if I click on it you’ll see it looks just like my excel file so looks
like everything is good to go we’ve successfully imported this data into our
into memory okay simple as that now once
you’ve done that now you can start doing the analysis so that’s what I wanted to
show you is how to read the data in not tomorrow this will probably turn into a
0 9 let’s hope the pattern persists because then we can programmatically do
that before we get too far let’s just keep it as is clean it up a little bit
let’s jump out of our our chunk and go back to this header covert data import</p>
<p>00:08
we’ve done that now let’s create one called kovat data cleanup we’ll call it
that I have no idea what we’re really going to do because this is for next
time and we’re just going to say this is been up of data let’s save this command
S or a file save let’s save it as script 1 and it’s in the directory where we
created the project hit save now what we can do we’re not really doing much here
let’s just go ahead and for fun create another R chunk called control I so alt
control insert think about it that way and let’s just do something simple as as
the we want the sum so we want the sum of the data frame that we just created
of all the new deaths total right I’m gonna hit play on that we should get a
number 35 84 so 3584 deaths total now we’re not gonna have to analysis in this
one but what I want to do is control s again save it let’s go ahead and render</p>
<p>00:09
this and I’ll show you what the output is so I go down here to my console and I
can do our markdown : : render and then let’s type in the exact thing here it’s
called an output in quotes to script 1 dot R MD and I think I could do yeah
let’s just leave it like that command or just enter because we’re in the console
hit enter it’s going to actually create a notebook HTML file which is basically
an HTML file if you go to your files here and we go to script 1 at RM d
that’s that but then below that we have script env HTML if you click on that you
can open an editor or view in browser I like to view it in browser because
sometimes the editor you do have to rely on our studio to be up to date with the
editor with the browser it truly is what
your browser would show if you gave this
file to somebody or upload it so here it is we have all of our stuff here and as</p>
<p>00:10
you can see at the bottom it’s 3584 we can hide the code we can hide all the
code but we have our headers we can globally hide or show all code we can
download this RMD file so you’ve successfully created this now there’s
not much here but I wanted to keep this short tomorrow let’s do a little bit
more so every day slightly more I advise you to play around with it and try this
out again again if you find these useful share it with your friends help me out
I’m trying to get to a monetization status which means I have to have a
thousand subscribers and about two thousand hours of watch time to be monetized
and I’m not even close but as long as you guys are continuously watching these
videos you’re helping me out and I appreciate that you [Music]End of file</p>
