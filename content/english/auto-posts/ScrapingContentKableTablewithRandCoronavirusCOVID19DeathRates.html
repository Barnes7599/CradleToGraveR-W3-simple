just a quick update I have a formula that’s incorrect and I want to make sure
it’s correct so I don’t confuse anybody around the lines 33 through 37 ish I
have a formula here in my mutate function it says death rate equals some
of the cases divided by some of the deaths that’s not a true formula for
finding the percentage it would be the number of deaths divided by the number
of cases that’s the correct formula and you know this this data frames not
really doing much except for displaying right here instead of doing this display
like that and you could see when I rendered it let’s render it I’ll show
you what it looks like and it’s not very pretty
our markdown render strip 1 dot Rd you’ll see that it’s not aesthetically
pleasing to the eye is basically what I’m showing you view and web browser let</p>
<p>00:01
me bring this over for you so even this it’s not the most pleasant look in that
table so let’s just go ahead and do a quick google on something called cable
cable R and we’ll just throw a cable function in there you know there’s some
good examples in here but let’s go to more of a tutorial there we go so as you
scroll down this particular page which is the cran our - project org I can
leave a link in the YouTube description but this this here is it’s going to show
you some cable cable tables so let’s just kind of scroll down and see what we
can find there are some that highlight as you as you I use as you hover over it
there’s all kinds of tables you can do now there’s a learning curve to some of</p>
<p>00:02
these so don’t get too excited let’s let’s just stay towards the top pick
something simpler like something like this right so let’s just copy this code
command see and it’s just gonna make it a little bit
more prettier and you can add things like buttons and I’ll show you how to do
that in a second so let’s go back to here we’re gonna have to load our
library now I don’t have cable installs so let’s do install packages packages
install we’re gonna do cable let’s do cable extra install and while
that’s doing that let’s go back here I’ve already copied this code but this
is the cable and cable extra so I think with cable extra you don’t need the</p>
<p>00:03
actual cable let’s try it so now just load library cable extra
that’s fine all right now what we’re gonna do is we’re going to assign this
to another data frame called enhanced data frame D D F and we’ll just run that
so now my EDF variable or data frame here it’s basically just a copy but it’s
got that extra feature the death rate so what we can do now is we can actually
call cable extra so if I do command V instead of DT it’ll be EDF EDF because
that’s the one we just created and we’re gonna do just like it says here let’s
see if it runs and it looks like we’re good to go
it actually puts it in the viewer as well over here but you can see this is a
lot cleaner looking and now remember save it command s and let’s rerender</p>
<p>00:04
this and so we’re gonna re render it let’s take a quick look go back to files
over here and once this is completed we’ll take a look but looks like we’re good
it’s a 2.6 megabyte file because we have a lot more data show and I guess let’s
go ahead and open this you know web browser alright so that’s a
much prettier table and but you can’t do much with it right not yet so what you
want to do is you want to find out ways to embed filters and search capability
so in the very next tutorial I will do that for you and if you do enjoy these
and you find it helpful please share it with your friends let other people see</p>
