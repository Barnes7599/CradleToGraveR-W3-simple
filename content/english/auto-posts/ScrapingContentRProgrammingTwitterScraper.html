okay today I’m gonna tell you about how to use our programming to capture
Twitter search results and capturing certain people’s tweets like at real
Donald Trump or anybody else you want to
grab their tweets from first you have to go to this site called apps twitter.com
and you have to register for a Twitter API this is free and really really
simple to do it’s literally just a couple lines that get to fill out I
already have one started called Trump grabber Wow let’s go ahead and create a
new one so this is what you’re gonna see is something similar to this if I click
on create new app the Internet’s a little slow where I’m at so bear with me
so the application details you have to name your application so my application
name was twenty trump grabber then you put a quick description in there no
problem now website if you don’t have a website it’s okay it’s telling you that
you don’t have to have a URL down here but you have to put something in there</p>
<p>00:01
so just put in some sort of placeholder like whatever website you want to put in
there put my placeholder your name whatever and then callback URL you don’t
need to input once you click on create your Twitter application it’s gonna
allow you to have a API key a secret API key some token keys go see
more about that in a minute but I’m not gonna show you that part that should be
intuitive and you should be able to do that pretty easily on your own you have
to create a what they call a token generator and I’ll show you that in a
second where that goes so let’s go to our and I’ll show you the code here now
I’ve already pre processed some of my data so that you can’t see my actual API
keys or my token keys but when you go to the Twitter account like I showed you
you would paste those in here so API key it’s very self-explanatory
cut and paste the API key from Twitter to where these X’s are same thing with
the API secret and then the access token and access token secret those will be
generated when you click on that little generate token button on the Twitter</p>
<p>00:02
account so that’s the most that’s the hardest part about grabbing tweets from
Twitter using are the two libraries you have to install it are the twitter are
and the are oauth libraries you can include the libraries like this as I did
in the code but you might have to install you can do you can write the command
line or you can go to packages install and just literally type in Twitter are
caps matters and then click on install there you have it so what I’m gonna do
is I’m gonna run through this and show you how to grab grab some tweets in
various ways and we’ll go from there because it’s
very simple I want you to be able to use this today so include these libraries
run the run that code run your API code so they are sort in these variables and
then on line 11 this is where this is where the magic happens where you
connect to the Twitter API so set up Twitter
ooofff off and then you put in your API key your API secret access token and
access token secret okay so now I’m gonna run these other this other code</p>
<p>00:03
where it says grab latest tweets so the first one on line 14 is going to run
code to grab 50 of real Donald Trump’s latest tweets so it’s from this is the
key part here from : real Donald Trump that’s how you do that
the next line here is at real Donald Trump what that’s going to do it’s going
to grab me the the latest 200 occurrences of a trail Donald Trump so
anybody could have tagged him and that’s what that will grab so let’s run that
one then of course the last one is just two keywords we’re looking for is it’s
gonna have the word morning in there and bacon and I want to grab the latest
hundred of these one key thing to know is that you can’t just arbitrarily grab
like 5,000 items per se you can but the the Twitter API will only allow you to
go back about a week or 10 days for something like that so if I ask for
Twitter’s last 5,000 tweets it’s gonna give a warning saying warning we’ve only
grabbed the latest you know 100 tweets because that’s all he’s tweeted in a 7
day period or whatnot I’ll show you that here in a second too</p>
<p>00:04
so we’ve got let’s put these into data frames right here on line 19 20 and 21
and we can see over here on the right where the data is tweets DF let’s click
on it and we go to it so we have under President Trump Trump unemployed and it
goes on and you can you can do it that way and we’ve got all these different
columns here favorite count how many times it’s been favorited what date was
created was it a retweet things like that so check out
these fields see what you can do with it reason why I turn a data frame because
it’s easier to manipulate that way because if you actually just use these
tweets that the tweets underscore Trump you’ll it’ll be all mushed together and
not easily usable then what I like to do sometimes is write these two CSV files
and that’s it so I created CSV files right here using write CSV and those
will show up in Excel so you can manipulate them that way as well okay so</p>
<p>00:05
that is it for creating a tweet scraper hope you enjoyed the videoEnd of file</p>
