hi welcome to my course my name is Martin grass I’m gonna walk you through
how to scrape Twitter using the Twitter API our studio and our all of this is
free and I’m gonna show you how to do all that within these videos it’s just a
few lines of code we walk through every bit of the code so you can kind of get
an understanding of how to use it how to
modify it for your own uses and then you
can build these cool word clouds and use the data however you’d like afterwards
you don’t necessarily need a programming background to follow suit however it’ll
help you manipulate the data later on if you want to make other changes other
than what I show you and finally in the next video I’m going to show you where
to get your Twitter API account setup so enjoy this courseEnd of file</p>
