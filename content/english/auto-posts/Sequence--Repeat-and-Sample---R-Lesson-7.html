welcome back to another tutorial today we’re going to talk about how to
generate sequences of numbers that is numbers say from 1 through 15 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 and so on or numbers that repeat for example 2 2 2 2 2 2 or numbers that
skip like 5 10 15 20 25 30 etc etc we’ll just go through a couple examples this
should be a pretty straightforward lesson so that being said let’s start
our project with a new project so we can start fresh
so file new let’s do an R script this time even though I like the notebooks I
just sometimes want to switch it back and forth so let’s just start on line
number 2 here and we’ll just assign a set of numbers to a variable so I’m
gonna say num1 we’re gonna assign that to now we’re going to use the c which is
what i’ve been referring to is like a column vector or a vector of numbers
some people use the word concatenate so the c will make sure you can concatenate</p>
<p>00:01
numbers so if i just want to generate numbers if i pick the numbers say 1 3 7
9 and i do command enter on that you’ll see on the right hand side my numbers is
a vector that contains those numbers now
this is not something that i can view in the viewer because it’s not a actual
matrix or a spreadsheet so in that case notice to view it we can
just type in the number and do command enter and you’ll see it at the bottom
the output is 1 3 7 9 simple enough with that and you can reassign them 1 it
doesn’t matter you can do C equals 2 4 6 and all of a sudden you repeat num1 and
you get 2 4 6 makes perfect sense all right so we’ve got number one figured
out let’s just keep it as the first example and we’ll do num 2 is equal to
10 11 12 so what’s cool is we can make it a third number that’s going to be the</p>
<p>00:02
concatenation of both of those numbers so that’s why i guess the word cad
catenation comes in we can actually concatenate concatenate both of those by
saying something like num 3 is equal to the combination so
of the concatenation of num1 and num2 it’s pretty simple
that’s great forward so now number three is gonna equal one three seven nine ten
eleven twelve so that’s how you would concatenate two
different sets of numbers that are just like that it’s pretty interesting so
let’s say you want to do a sequence of numbers you can simply type in numbers
one through ten with a colon so one through ten if I hit command enter on
that you get the sequence one through ten it does it automatically for you of
course you can do any numbers you want five through 20 it doesn’t matter
it goes generate something so you want to if you want to put those into a
variable though we can do num for as assigned to the numbers 5 through 20 and
if we do number 4 so the various ways to do this there’s plenty of ways to do</p>
<p>00:03
this and you’re gonna see all kinds of different methods so I want to show you
the basics so let’s say we want to do a sequence that starts a certain number
and skips numbers let’s just do a sequence so seq and we’ll just do a from
and we’ll do a starting value of 2 and we’ll say it’s gonna go to 20 and we’re
gonna step it by say by twos so by a equals 2 so you set these parameters you
hit enter and you have a sequence if you look at the bottom here 2 4 6 8 10 all
the way up through 20 so it’s a sequence and it’s from a 2 and a bi and if I did
by equals 1 it’s simply just the same thing as if you just did 2 through 20
like so so those two are the same and of course you can assign these two
variables all you want so number 5 assign it to that sequence of numbers
and we’re good to go one thing to know about R which is
something you’ll need to know in the future when you start dealing with big</p>
<p>00:04
data is that once R has this stored in memory say the sequence of 2 through 20
and other parts of your program reference other variables that are also
2 through 20 it actually doesn’t make a copy of it until it needs to R is smart
enough to know that hey I’ve got a sequence of numbers 2 through 20 and
nobody’s touched it yeah and it’s still 2 through 20 so if five places want to
store a variable called 2 through 20 are will no only store 2 through 21
and point it to that point all those other variables to that spot it’s not
that important now but when you deal with rows that are in the millions and
columns that go into the thousands you really don’t want to make and generate
copies of things that you don’t really need to until you need to so when you
need to you need to but you don’t need to let’s not waste space that’s
basically what I’m saying so the next function I want to show you is the
repeat function so that’s just as simple
as re P and again if you just let it sit
there you get this little yellow box you can hit the tab or hit the parentheses</p>
<p>00:05
then tab and it tells you what are we repeating so let’s do a repeat we’re
gonna repeat the number two and we’re gonna say
how many times with x equals seven we want to repeat to seven times hit enter
and there you go on the bottom you see the output in my console seven twos
pretty straightforward it’s all useful it’s very useful this also works with
characters so let’s try something like repeat I want to repeat the character a
how many times I want to repeat it ten times and we have ten A’s and it doesn’t
have to be a you can do Apple and it’ll repeat Apple ten times so it’s pretty
interesting how you can do that what’s really cool though you can you can
really concatenate the foot you can actually put functions within functions
and make it really neat for example let’s do a repeat and we’re going to
repeat not the letter A or Apple we’re gonna repeat a combination or a</p>
<p>00:06
concatenation or a column of things called apples and we’ll call it pears so
we have apples and pears see how it’s embedded in that see inside those
parentheses so it’s in a way one unit called apple pear it’s like a dictionary
item or a key lookup palette whatever you want to call it but how many times
do I want to repeat that I want to repeat that five times and what do we
have Apple pears Apple pears Apple pears five times so that’s an interesting way
to have repeating patterns and all that corresponds to numbers as well finally I
want to show you one last thing it’s called a sample so if you want to do a
number of samples let’s say I have our numbers and we’re gonna sign numbers 1
through 100 and we want a random sample of that so now we’re starting to really
talk about some statistics caveat I’m not a statistician and I just know
little bits and pieces that I’m going to
show you throughout this because this is a more programmatic course and tutorial</p>
<p>00:07
than statistician I’m not a statistician but I will show you what I know along
the way so if you want to take a random sample of these numbers so numbers 1
through hundreds so we have the numbers let’s just type in numbers and look at
them we have a hundred numbers I want to take a random sample so I’m I’m the
scientist I go out to the field and say I want to
randomly pick 15 of these so how do we do that
well we take a sample which is a another
function that’s built into our what do I want to take a sample of I want to take
a sample of the numbers and how big of a sample do I want I want to take 10
random samples okay so now the next question is if I hit comma and I hit tab
you’re gonna see replace equals let’s read what that one says should sampling
be with replacement what that means is if I pull a 7 randomly and I said that
was a random number for sure am I putting that 7 back in the pool and then
I pull again and I might get a 7 again and then another 7 there’s a possibility
there’s a probability that that’ll happen so if we don’t want that to
happen so we pull that 7 on that 7 is no
longer in the pool you’ll never possibly</p>
<p>00:08
get that again if you you would normally I would say most of your samples are
going to be random samples without replacement
so you’re gonna say replace equals false therefore we get this random sample of
numbers if you see down below 31 excited center etc and they’re different every
time you run it right so that’s how you get a random number and I hope you play
around with some of these numbers and get used to these see using the
concatenation or the column vector how if you want to look at it finally if you
haven’t subscribed below so you know when my next lesson comes out I’m going
to try to put these lessons out all the time and it’s going to cater to beginner
to intermediate level R and programming in general so see you in the next lesson
