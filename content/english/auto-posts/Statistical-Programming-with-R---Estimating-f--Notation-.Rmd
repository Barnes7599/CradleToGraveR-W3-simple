well it looks like we're doing har but I tricked you
we're gonna do a little bit of math I'm gonna show you a couple things we're
gonna create a little coordinate system here this is your basic XY coordinate
system this is your quadrant one quarter two three four just like the normal XY
coordinate system that you would normally see but these are not gonna be
X's and Y's instead we're gonna call it deaths and cases or cases and deaths so
let's go ahead and label that and so we can do cases along the horizontal axis
and we will do deaths along the y axis or the vertical axis I should say
all right so what we want to do is try to make a correlation between a the
number of cases and the number of deaths

00:01
so is there anything correlated is there a relationship there we don't know so
let's try to get the terminology down and the lingo down first and then we'll
dive into more statistics later but what I want to show you first is that as we
actually have this data which we have so let's just go ahead I'm not good with
this thing yet I just started using it now but we have an observation here we
have an observation we have an observation and we have all these
observations and it exponential exponentially goes up whatever it might
be right we have all these observations these are true factual observations we
know that we counted this many cases can we gather this many deaths now they
might not might not be any relationship at all that's what we're trying to
determine at the end of the day but we're going to call this first
observation a capital X and we'll put a little subscript for one there so X 1 is

00:02
the first observation and then you know X 2 or X 3 would be here and then it
keeps on going on and on until you get to X P which is the number of
observations total so your last observation is your P of P values if P
observations right so that's how we denote that so we have all these X's and
we have cases so what can we do to predict the next X well we can kind of
estimate like well maybe it's kind of an upward trajectory I kind of gave you a
hint with this which was fade of course but you know maybe the next one will be
here or maybe here we don't know there's some error term in that
so to puck to put this in mathematical notation we're gonna start with some
basic we're gonna do a capital y back it's gonna look like this
it's a terrible why that's a terrible way anyways y is equal to some function
of the observations so that particular observation X right so if I have an
observation X it'll go into this magic box called the function do something to
the X and tell me how many deaths are except there's more to it there's a

00:03
little bit of an error rate with that because we can never really know so we
have this error you call it a 1 or epsilon 1 now this is the actual
function right we actually don't know the function because tomorrow it could
be here it could be here it could be here so this is the true real function
now in real life we don't have an exact function for this data so what we do is
we estimate the function so this is a reducible error function and this is a
irreducible error error term so to denote that it's actually just an
estimate we're going to use a Y with a little hat on top so Y hat equals F hat
of the observation plus the error term now Y is X not with a hat because we
know the observation that's a true fact we counted how many cases count how many

00:04
deaths now on paper we get of course in real life we didn't but this is the way
you denote this function we estimate a function plus some error rate is going
to predict some death rate so instead of wise in X's the true at Aransas would
have been deaths equals some function ups of the observation plus the epsilon
okay so that's the basics of the notation that we might use to start
predicting values so the goal is figure out alright there's X P what about X of
P plus 1 where'd you find or how many deaths would be associated with X of P
plus 1 you would plug this thing in to this function if you had it but we don't
have it so instead we've got to plug it into our estimated function our estimate
could be anything could be a linear estimate it could be quadratic it could
be all kinds of weird functions plus some error term that you cannot reduce
that's an irreducible error and that error error with each observation if you

00:05
average all the errors it will equal to 0 that's the assumptions of our model so
this is the basic 101 quick and dirty of how to do basic stats and I hope that
you continue with these lessons and I'll show you how to put some of this into
the our program and do some predictive analysis [Music] you [Music]End of file
