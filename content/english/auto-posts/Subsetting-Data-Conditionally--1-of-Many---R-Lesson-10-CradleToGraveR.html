okay all right we’re back and we’re we did some subset in last time we’re gonna
continue on with subset in this time we’re going to put a couple of
conditional statements in there which will help us narrow down our searches
we’re also going to use a different data
set we’re going to use the iris data set which also comes with our so that makes
it easy for us to practice with so that being said let’s set our data a frame
we’ll call it plants we’re gonna let that we’re going to assign the iris data
set to that so iris is just plant iris just like that if I hit command enter
you’ll see in my environment plants 150 observations of five variables remember
how to do that programmatically you can do dim and do plant we get the
dimensions and down below in our console
150 and five right number of columns and call plant and I may have made out of
showed you these but remember there’s tons of ways to do everything you’re
gonna have to learn to use Google and Stack Overflow but by practicing these</p>
<p>00:01
when you see the results in Stack Overflow you’re gonna understand how to
apply those results to your very specific example and that’s crucial
because you’re never gonna find the exact thing that you looking forward
you’ll find something close and if you can read the program in syntax and you
can say oh oh I get it now and you can modify it to your needs because what is
it like 90% of all code is just cut and paste from Stack Overflow with a few
modifications sadly or good I don’t not sure quick joke is a Stack
Overflow was created without Stack Overflow if you don’t get it that’s ok
maybe later alright n rows or n row plant and we hit enter 150 rows so we
get all this stuff out of their names that’s very important we want to know
what kind of header file do we have plant and we have the names down here we
have length width and that’s a sepal length sepal width and we have petal
length petal width and then the species alright so now that we have kind of an
idea of guess what this data is we really don’t know what kind of data is</p>
<p>00:02
in there though so let’s just do ahead and type in plant and let’s just capture
the first three rows for funsies all right here we go and we have okay some
numbers have four to five different numbers in there looks like
the pet pedal with 0.2 maybe we should have done let’s do it let’s do 10
observations just get a little better feel okay so it looks like the petal
width is a decimal number for the most part there might be some greater I don’t
know in fact let’s just figure that out by using our subset function so here in
our in our set of 10 we have up to 0.4 let’s see if there’s anything point 5 or
greater so let’s just do that as an example so what we’re gonna do is going
to do subset it’s a function built-in and we’re gonna subset what the plant
database or data frame sorry and what I didn’t show you before was that you can
type in the word plant then the dollar sign and it gives you all of the names
of the headers right here so we want to know if there’s any petal widths</p>
<p>00:03
so go down to pedal with hit enter on that so now you have it there we want to
know if any of those are greater than 0.4 let’s do greater than point 4 1
because we know there’s a point 4 in there and I’m gonna hit enter and right
now we have 10 observations showing but remember the actual observation count is
150 because that was just a sample or the top 10 top 10 as in the first 10 I
got to be very careful with what I say here so here we have a bunch of numbers
but I don’t think we have them all well let’s find out out let’s do a dimension
on it because let’s do a number of rows and row of the subset see how you can
concatenate functions like this 102 so 102 out of 150 observations have a petal
width that is greater than 0.40 1 okay cool let’s do a petal with greater than
point 4 1 and it has to have a let’s say let’s go up to the top here and look at</p>
<p>00:04
these names again let’s say a sepal length greater than 6 so let’s do an and
in there remember these parentheses which is one
nice thing about our studio is whenever you have your arrow on the parenthesis
you can see the correspondent pregnancy kind of highlighted so you know okay
that closes that the next one over closes that function so you can kind of
keep track of where you’re at you want to be within the innermost parentheses
and instead of a comma you’re not gonna do a comma here you can do it
and so the end is just the ampersand okay and and then we want to put the
entire condition which is we want the plant sepal length I believe that we’ve
said sepal length greater than six now let’s do command enter on that and we’ve
got o so the number of rows that has that is 61 if you want to see what they
are you can get rid of the N row parentheses like that should not matter
and here they are here the outputs well if you want to save that something you</p>
<p>00:05
can you can say you know your special special plant let’s assign it to this
let’s make this look a little better let’s let’s put an enter here white
space typically doesn’t matter so now you can see it all in one screen okay so
now we set it as special plant and if you look over here in our environment we
have special plant sixty one of those revisions now we can do all of our
analysis on this subset of the data so that’s the cool part about subsets in
and that’s one way to do it we can do an or statement let’s do a or statement
let’s say we want to subset our plant database or our plant data frame with I
said sepal length I think I said less than 3 and then anyways the or symbol is
the pipe which is above the return key usually and a shift or we want plant</p>
<p>00:06
petal people left less than 3 petal width that’s it I said less than 0.2
okay yeah I don’t know anything about plants obviously so we’ve got a list of
looks like five observations how do we know it’s five well we can do well we
can do dimensions and get the dimensions
of it because that might be important so five columns and 5 rows we could have
done rows remember okay simple as that the main point of this is to subset use
in one of the features quantities and you can use the or and the end and you
can combine these as much as you want I can do an or or or I
can do an and and an you know so basically look at the syntax of how I
did this the entire conditional statement is on the right-hand side of
this two parameter function so the first
parameter is the actual data frame which is plant and then the second parameter
is this entire thing which leads to a vector of trues and falses and that’s</p>
<p>00:07
kind of important so what it actually returns it’s a true false true true true
false false whatever these conditions satisfies and if it if it satisfies a
false that gets put into the the subset function and it knows only pluck out the
truths from the original data set plant more on that as we go but those are some
terminologies you’re gonna have to learn and I hope this helps you with your
subset in practice don’t forget to practice and there’s gonna be probably a
dozen more ways to do the same exact thing and I’ll probably go through most
of them throughout the entire lesson set see you in the next lessonEnd of file</p>
