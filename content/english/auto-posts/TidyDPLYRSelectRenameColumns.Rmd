today I'm gonna show you a random function from the deep liar package that
will allow you to select a certain column of a CSV file but at the same
time as selecting it we're gonna change the name of that column now the reason
why you'd want to do something like that
is let's say that it's not aesthetically pleasing to the eye or it's misleading
and you want to create a good awesome report for management that doesn't
really need to need to see like periods or underscores if you haven't installed
the plier you would click on install and then make sure you're at the cran
repository and just type in DPL yr - plier and then click on install I
already have it installed on my machine so I'm gonna go ahead and cancel that it
might take a few minutes to install if you haven't downloaded all the
dependencies it'll do it all automatically but it might take just a
few minutes so let that run and once you're done catch up and type in library

00:01
and let's load the deep liar package so that's loaded I hit ctrl enter so let
it's load it up in my RAM good to go now I want to I want to grab a file that I
put in my project folder the project folder is right here under files so I
have a project folder called select example less the directory and my actual
file is called demographic statistics by zip code so that's the name of it let's
take a quick peek at that let's load that in so let's just do my data and
we're going to assign that equal to read CSV and we're going to type in
demographic typically you can type in part of it and hit tab and it'll fill in
the rest if that file is within your project directory so that was nice I
didn't have to type all that out even though it's in quotes pretty cool
feature of our studio when do control enter on that and boom you see in my

00:02
global environment 236 observations of 46 variables let's take a quick peek and
as you can see these names are all capitalized and they have the dot
notation so there's no spaces which is generally good when you're dealing with
computer type things you don't want spaces typically you want under
or dashes or something like that but we're gonna send this to management so
we don't want to have for example count dot female we want a more aesthetically
pleasing one let's call that number of females we'll leave everything else the
same in fact we're only gonna select the first three features so let's go ahead
and just let's print those out by doing names and type in my data simple as that
and you can see them populate down at the bottom console area now that it's
there let's change the name let's select
just the first three so we're just gonna do my data and we're gonna assign it my
data except for we're going to pipe the data into the deployer function first so

00:03
ctrl shift M we'll add the percent greater than percent if you don't know
much about piping you might need to look up some of those things but we're going
to pipe my data into the Select function and what are we going to select we're
going to select jurisdiction so I'm gonna start typing that in hit tab , I'm
gonna hit enter just for white space we're going to use count dot
participants comma and we're gonna use count dot female and again I'm just
tabbing to autocomplete now we don't want percent female we're gonna change
that one we want it to be percent of females so I'm going to type in percent
of females and I'm gonna set it equal to that feature called percent dot female
this won't quite work yet because now we
have a problem we have spaces here we're gonna enclose this with the back tick

00:04
the back tick is to the left of the number one it is not a single quote I
repeat it is not a single quote it is a back tick so let's put a back tick on
each one sometimes our studio will try to autocomplete a back tick like this you
need to get rid of the extra backtick it needs to be just enclosed by one back
tick each now what it's going to do is when it pulls in percent dot female it's
going to go ahead and reassign it to percent of females for us now this isn't
a practical real-world example but you'll get the point across
so when I run this what you're gonna see is it's going to pull the first four
features but that fourth feature is going to say percent of females and you
can imagine changing up all of them to something aesthetically please control
enter and no errors which is good let's go ahead and view my data in the viewer
control enter and here we go you can see it's got jurisdiction done named
participants female and an aesthetically pleasing percent of females human

00:05
readable so that's the idea is you want to be able to change the name as you
pull them in saves you a couple extra steps it's not difficult but it's just
something that might help you out in the future so new name equals old name done
deal that's the D plier function it's all part of the tidy verse welcome to
