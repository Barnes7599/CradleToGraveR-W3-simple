welcome back to the third tutorial this is Mark Jin grass teaching you how to
use basic are commands and how to navigate the our studio a little bit now
if you’re just coming in we already have a project file open with an R markdown
file here we’re gonna disregard that for now anyway so let’s hit the little X on
it and close it out as you can see it’s still in your bottom right hand side
where the files are it is under the RMD file if you click on that it will reopen
and appear like magic but we’re not going to mess with that right now let’s
get it out of the way let’s play with the console again okay we’re back in the
console and we have nothing in our global environment and if you do and you
want to start from scratch hit that little broom button it’ll clear
everything out okay now in our it’s a statistical it was built for</p>
<p>00:01
statisticians back in the day I don’t know the whole history of it but they
deal with a lot of numbers and when you deal with a lot of numbers in big data
you deal with usually matrices everyone should kind of have a feeling for the
matrix is think of it as a spreadsheet full of number so you rows and you have
columns and you have numbers and every single cell just like a Microsoft Excel
file would now picture this a column of that spreadsheet or of that matrix going
downward that column can be considered what I would call a vector if you just
extracted one column of a matrix or of a spreadsheet you highlighted the entire
column and you said give me that that is a useful object in our we’re going to
consider that a vector it’s basically a string of numbers or bits of text but
not a combination of both the power of R is that most of these functions can use</p>
<p>00:02
a vector directly as input which really simplifies coding in many applications
because you avoid using for loops so imagine I wanted to take a vector of
numbers let’s say the first column of a matrix
that might be a thousand numbers in a row and I wanted to multiply them by two
well the old-fashioned way or the other programming language way is to run a
loop and iterate through each and every single number and multiply each number
by two and restore it and things like that so with our you can typically just
take take the entire vector and say multiply the vector by two done anyways
well we’ll walk through some of the internals of that as we progress through
first let’s assign a vector to a variable we’re gonna call this number
one and remember the assignment is the less than - you can actually use an
equal sign - but it’s preferred to use the less ten - as to not get it confused</p>
<p>00:03
with the equality or the equivalent or the is something actually equivalent to
something else does number one equal equal in some languages you’d use double
equals to say hey don’t assign this just to see if they’re the same anyways
number one equals now we’re going to use this letter of lowercase C open
parentheses and as you can see that it closes the parentheses forming yours
good as well if it doesn’t show me a message and I’ll walk you through how to
fix that it’s in the sentence now the C stands for just like I said in Excel
column it’s it’s like a column of numbers so think of it as a vector or
column and we’re going to put numbers in there we’re going to separate them by
commas like a comma separated value maybe so maybe the number 1 4 or 1 3 4 7
10 11 whatever we want to put in there these happen to be all integers now</p>
<p>00:04
remember we’re in the console you can just hit the enter button oh now you’ll
see in your values up here in your global environment
number one the the variable called number one takes on the values you see
some of this notation is a little bit confusing it takes on the values of num
which is a numeric 1 : 7 what does that even mean it’s actually 1 through 7
memory slots 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 s numbers are stored into number one as a
vector just like that see the column so if you count them across you’ll have
seven elements of this vector now I said we can do basic arithmetic but we can
also put that entire number one in two functions like a function like some
normally you would do some 2 plus or 2 comma 2 and it would give you for some 3</p>
<p>00:05
comma 5 it should give you 8 now you can also do 3 comma 5 4 comma 5 and it’ll
give you the answer wow that’s pretty cool in other languages you’d have to
actually define if you had three parameters coming into the function
you’d have to define that separately than two parameters or one parameter etc
etc but luckily our takes in columns of numbers and it gives you back results
almost everything in our that you’re going to come across you have to kind of
think of it as columns of numbers even if it’s just one single number it’ll
really help you kind of internalize what’s going on so let’s do a sum
instead of putting in an actual number we’re gonna put in our variable called
number one I hit enter on that and it sums them up to be 40 you can count them
and double check that it does 21 25 27 close enough 40 okay so that’s cool that</p>
<p>00:06
we can do that we can also do number one times two and look what will happen now
it actually doubled the numbers to 6 8 14 20 22 8 pretty cool you can see the
old numbers here still so it did double them now if I type in number 1 again
you’ll notice that they’re not doubled interesting here’s why you didn’t assign
the double number to anything if you hit the up arrow on your keyboard it’ll
bring back the last commands that you’ve
done number 1 hit up again it’ll go back
as far as you want just keep hitting the UP button little shortcut method hit up
twice or get to the point where number 1 times 2 and this time we’re
going to assign it and we’re gonna assign it back to itself number 1 now
before I hit enter I want to show you that remember that the right-hand side
of the assignment operator the right hand side is evaluated first and then it</p>
<p>00:07
assigns it to the left hand side so you don’t have to worry about well that’s a
weird assignment I can’t assign it to itself well it doesn’t in memory it’s
actually making copies and doing all kinds of things so number one it’s gonna
take the number one vector or a column of numbers multiply each one by two and
then it’s going to assign that entire vector to a new variable called number
one and number one will be a vector now look also before you hit enter that
number one up here with the 1 3 4 7 it will all double in just a second I hit
enter and they’re doubled so now number 1 enter they are definitely doubled now
of course R comes standard with statistical things like don’t take the
mean of number 1 it’ll give you the mean
which is the average now let me give you another shortcut when you start typing
in a variable or common things in R you can hit the tab and it will autocomplete
so if I wanted to type in number 1 again I can just type in and you a more and</p>
<p>00:08
then hit the tab button and it pulls up a list number 1 is what I want and you
just hit enter that way it’s very simple normally you would type in enough that
if you hit the tab that that’s the only option and you hit tab and it just fills
the rest in for you again you can do things like length of the actual number
one and length will give you the how many elements are in that vector and if
you’re coming from a different language you might have called it an array but in
my head for some reason an array to me is a continuous set of numbers from left
to right instead of a column of numbers so I don’t want to confuse anybody that
way and an array in most languages is going to be a continuous set of memory
that are contiguous I’m not a hundred percent sure
how that works in our but they probably have something very similar to it
finally you can do things like communal it come you calm you looked have some I</p>
<p>00:09
cannot say that word so come some number one it’ll give you the communal of
coming yeah you know what I’m talking about okay and there’s a list of things
you can do with that number one you can find minimum you can find max you can
find the unique values now we didn’t really go over what this what I’m
actually doing here like unique max community of some length those are all
functions that take an input that input is the number one right now so inside
the parentheses it’s a input to a function called unique but unique is
internal to our and it’s part of the our language so we really have to know the
internal workings of it at this point one other useful one is sort and if you
sort number one it’ll sort it by default lowest to highest now what we can do is</p>
<p>00:10
we can do sort and do number one and what you’ll see is this little pop-up I
didn’t touch anything that yellow and I’ll zoom in on it on the video it says
sort open paren C X comma decreasing equals false command dot dot dot that’s
a lot in one take so we’re gonna we’re gonna break this down to just the X and
the word decreasing equals false the rest will cancel for now but number
one is the X it’s saying hey sort takes in parameters one parameter is a data a
set of data and that data that we’re bringing it in the function is calling
an X to give you an idea of hey X my data our data is contained in the
variable number one so we’re gonna put that in that slot the X slot it’s in
order in this case comma if I put a comment in there and actually if I hit
tab with the comma in there it’ll actually bring it up it’s the parameter list</p>
<p>00:11
and this decrease in equals Falls we’re going to go down and it’s going to give
you an example of what that means should the sort be increasing decreasing for
the radix method that it uh so it’s really helpful tip and I’m gonna hit
enter on that I’m going to type in true now when I hit enter it’s it’s going the
other direction so whenever you have a function and there’s multiple parameters
you can get hints by doing those techniques for example maybe we want to
do a round of so round number we around some number and see how this one has
something similar says round X comma digits equals zero so the default is
digit equals zero we can override the default by saying digits and again you
can hit the tab key and learn how to do all that stuff digits equals to hit
enter we have two digits after the decimal digits equal three we have three
digits after the decimal again you can start typing in round and once you hit</p>
<p>00:12
that parenthesis that little yellow box pops up at this point you can also hit
the tab button and it’ll give you the parameter values the order doesn’t
matter if you type in x equals and digits equals digits equals three and
now I’m gonna make X equal some number that’s fine
but when you start doing things like without the X you’re going to run into
problems so the order only matters when you’re going out of order so make sure
that you understand that concept I think
this will wrap it up and I’m sorry I did
not get to the are notebook but the next lesson I shared I hope this video was
useful and if it was leave a comment below let me know how and also subscribe
that’ll help me grow my channel and continue creating videos like thisEnd of file</p>
