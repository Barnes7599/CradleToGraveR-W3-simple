in this quick tutorial I'm gonna show you how to use the deep liar package to
summarize specific columns based on variables it's pretty cool very powerful
and very quick and succinct so let's jump right to it
so we're gonna start off with just using the empty cars set but first let's load
our library the deep liar library and if you don't have the deep lie library as
always packages install deep liar and install all right so libraries loaded I
ran that command enter now I purposely made my console large so that we can see
the outputs pretty easily so let's just quickly do a quick run of what empty
cars is as you probably all know by now it's got different features miles per
gallon cylinder etc etc and all these different numbers now let's do something

00:01
with that let's summarize in certain way so the first one will do remember empty
cars and then remember the shortcut key command shift M will give you the pipe
operator and the pipe operator works on two plier package tidy verse things like
that and so what we want to do is we want to group these by something so
group under scrub by what do we want to group these by it let's group these by
for example cylinder so CY L and what do we want to do with that group and well
we want to summarize so summarize and we want to summarize basically say we want
the maximum horsepower so we can do max and put in horsepower in there and
command enter and lo and behold down below we have alright so with a for the
four cylinder the maximum horsepower is 113 for the six the maximum HP is 175
etc etc but we don't have to stop there we can do we can also do a mean in there
we can also do the mean horsepower whatever we want to do we can add it in

00:02
here I want to summarize by mean horsepower so let's run that so now we
have the max and the mean maybe we want the men as well let's do the men
some men horsepower it's that simple folks and what that's not a very
aesthetically pleasing column name so let's go name these so instead of Max
I'm gonna I'm gonna actually call it max horsepower equals right and same thing
with the mean and I'm making these names up right now so max me or mean
horsepower equals and mean and min horsepower equals so let's run that make
it a little bit more aesthetically pleasing so now you see down at the
bottom here we have cylinders we have maximum horsepower the average and the
minimum pretty cool pretty powerful stuff right there right simple as that
okay I cleared the output now let's do something a little bit more fancy here

00:03
we're gonna use the empty cars again except we'll pipe that into a group by
and we're gonna group a by cylinder again but this time we're gonna do
something slightly different instead of summarizing a particular
feature like horsepower we want to summarize all of the features with a
certain function so with that we're going to use summarize instead of
summarized we're gonna do summarize all and what that means is all the variables
run this function against so we want to say we want the mean of all the
variables I'm gonna go ahead and run that so based on the cylinder I have the
average of all of these features below pretty powerful we could do the max I
can change it to max and we have the maximum of all the features below min
any type of function that is no relatively common you can use that for
pretty powerful powerful stuff now let's go beyond that let's get even crazier
here and let's do the same thing except alright let's group AB I will do

00:04
cylinder again so group by cylinder and the wrong buttons my keyboard shortcuts
command shift M my keyboard is not a Mac keyboard but I'm on a Mac so it's it
gets confusing sometimes all right so we're a group by cylinders just like we
did before and we did summarize all with
max but this time we wanted to summarize all
and instead of Mac's we're gonna add a few other functions in there so
Wednesday funds to get like a list of functions will give it a list argument
the list is going to contain we want min Max and mean now let's run that and we
get an error empty car is not found empty car and I found let's try the
proper way empty cars and as you can see here it's got a lot of stuff in here
that you can't even see so let's pipe this right into a view instead so we're

00:05
gonna add the pipe operator and capital VI u W and we can go ahead and just run
that into our viewer and what you see here is you have cylinders we grouped it
by cylinder miles per gallon minimum displacement minimum horsepower minimum
drag minimum everything minimum then we have everything max all after that and
then at the very end we have the average so just like that that fast you can get
minimum maximum average of all the features in your entire your entire
dataset just like that it's very very very powerful features okay so that's
another thing you've just learned just like that
now these you're gonna to practice because it's hard to memorize these the
first couple times you do in fact I don't use it very often so I have to
look them up a lot of times alright I've cleared my screen again and
what we're gonna do is we're gonna add to what we already have here so as you
can tell we started off with a simple group by group by cylinder easy
summarized what I want to summarize I want to summarize these types of things

00:06
for all the variables I want max horsepower 404 the horsepower variable
then we've decided we want more than one variable I want all the variables but I
want to get the maximum of all the variables okay cool but now we decided
all right I want all the variables but I
also want multiple functions to plot the to be applied to all the variables so
that's min Max and mean we want it to be applied to all of the variables so now
let's do summarize a so it's very simple empty cars same thing group by we want
to bye let's do cylinder again as the example and we want to says summarize
although this time we're going to do summarise act so it's just like
somewhere is all except this time we're specifying which variables to be really
one of summarize that so Affairs and then you want to do let's say we want to
summarize the wait and the draft only now we can apply functions to those two
only let's do min and Max and let's let's just pipe that right into the view

00:07
so we could see it better well actually I guess that's pretty short so we have
the minimum the maximum and the the minimum drat the wait max the minimum
anyways we have exactly what I just described in just that short period of
time so let's let's do this one more time without the view put it on the our
viewer and that's so simple it is so I if you want to find any type of group in
with some sort of function applied to it and eventually you can apply your own
functions you don't need to use min max you can create your own functions and
apply those it's very simple you [Music]End of file
