in this video I’m going to talk about the function called D put and this
function is useful for when you want to actually try to troubleshoot with a
friend or someone that’s on Stack Overflow you want to put reproducible
code on Stack Overflow if you don’t put the reproducible code
on Stack Overflow then you’re gonna get reprimanded and they’re gonna say hey
give me an example that you can reproduce and creating data frames from
scratch can be somewhat tedious if you’re not too familiar with the
structure of your data frame and how to reproduce that so I’m gonna show you a
way to do that in a easy way and I think that you will enjoy the fact that you
can do this now so that being said I’m gonna grab a data from this website here
it’s our world in data org and slash coronavirus - testin i blew it up for
you so you can see what this is but if you scroll down here to the CSV file
what I’m gonna do is I’m going to right click and copy this link address and
that’s where I’m gonna paste it into our</p>
<p>00:01
studio and I’m going to do a Kovach data is equal to assign it to read dot CSV
and we’ll just plug in that URL control V command enter so what we see is
copa-data has 32 variables of 20,000 plus observations you can click on it
check check it out here it is read all about it close that what you
can tell though is there’s no way I can reproduce 20,000 plus observations of 32
variables there’s no way I can paste that type of text inside of Stack
Overflow I would get reprimanded big time so let’s use that D put function
will start with just saying hey here’s my subset well that’s bad word to use
cuz - reserved word for are here’s my Kovan sub set and we set that equal to a</p>
<p>00:02
we’re gonna use D put and we’re gonna bring in our Cova data but but we don’t
want all of 20,000 observations so let’s
use the bracket syntax to say hey I only want the
first three rows 1 through 3 1 : threes 1 2 3 and then comma every single column
that’s what the blank means means all columns command enter and you’re
thinking well what is kovetz sub mean what does deep what mean it doesn’t
really mean much as is but what you can see down here is in the output
he created a lot of text so let’s grab this this entire text so starting with
the word structure all the way down and I’m gonna do a ctrl C and I’m gonna come
back up and I’m gonna say what could call it Co vid struct for structure
right what am I gonna sign that I’m just gonna do ctrl V right here it kind of
look like crap see you’ve got all of this data that’s</p>
<p>00:03
been pasted it doesn’t look that good so let’s clean that up a little bit so
highlight from rows 5 all the way down to let’s go to 23 just to be sure
well let’s go 24 doesn’t matter I haven’t showed you this yet but it’s a
really cool feature ctrl shift a the letter A will clean that up for us boom
so now we have we have our original data set pulled from this website we have a
we have the structure of a subset of that data set and then we have the
structure being stored here well not the structure this is actually
recreating the data frame called Cove instruct we haven’t run this code yet so
let me run it real quick command enter now let me scroll back up so you can see
that again so co-construct if you look over here in
the environment codes sub is three observations covert struct is 300
Asian’s of 32 variables yeah yeah so i recreated it is basically
what it is so in your I know that I know</p>
<p>00:04
they look like the same thing but if you copy row 3 to stack overflow
they don’t have Kovan data they don’t have this so it’s not going to work
somebody can’t reproduce this now they can reproduce this particular example if
they have the website but let’s just pretend they don’t have that website
let’s say it’s your own data set on your own computer that’s not a publicly
available but you want to give a subset of that so pretend that
and so that’s why this won’t work but this will here’s the caveat not really a
caveat but the rest of your code might be using Kovac data as a variable so
Kovac data here’s a function I’m putting
in there and it’s not working any help I
need help on Stack Overflow and then you use the word copa-data 15 more times
what I recommend doing is literally when
you’re gonna post this is just call this
this recreation of the data frame with a subset the same variable name so I’m
gonna call it copa-data now you don’t want to keep it this way you can comment</p>
<p>00:05
this out and go back to the original data set that’s fine but that way all
the code below this way down here will you handle some of your code data stuff
is going to be it’s still gonna work right they’re just gonna be working on a
smaller subset so you can actually copy and paste this into Stack Overflow and
they would recreate this particular data
frame right here I hope that makes sense to you now we didn’t arbitrarily pick
well we did our trade pick rows 1 through 3 but let’s make that a little
bit more a little bit more convincing that it’s a random sample so let’s
create an index we’re gonna say hey this
index is gonna be random numbers so when say index of what do we want to want a
random sample I want to run a sample of index numbers so row numbers right so we
know there’s 20,000 556 so we can do one through twenty thousand 556 random
number I want three three random numbers from that subset or from that set of</p>
<p>00:06
numbers and I don’t want the same number twice so replace equals false simple as
that right command enter we have an index looks like our numbers are right
here you can see them in 11 thousand 900 okay well what if our dataset changes
tomorrow let’s get rid of this and let’s make this a little bit more dynamic so
we’re gonna call that number rows remember in row and we’ll put in
kovaydin data so now we’re gonna do the same thing when I hit enter you’re gonna
see that I have my index command it’s the same set of three numbers but
it still worked because the enro goes up there now the reason why this didn’t
change numbers because it is random is because white didn’t exchange I was
gonna talk about set seeds set dot seed equals some number
any number you want you can pick any arbitrary number set the seed and then</p>
<p>00:07
run the index again you’ll see oh I’m getting an error okay so let’s go back
let’s let’s pretend I didn’t say set seed and spell this correctly COV ID
there we go index okay so as it’s supposed to do if every time I run this
is supposed to have different numbers so I’m gonna run it again you can see I’m
17 401 is that first one command enter it’s a different set of numbers a
different set of numbers every time right so keep doing that different set
of numbers now that could be a problem because you want to reproduce this
example over and over again so that’s where set dot seed comes in take any
number you want throw it in there I mean be reasonable I guess but it’s your
number that you’re gonna say hey every time I want a random sample because
nothing is truly random unless you’re talking quantum physics here you can
reproduce that random sample over and over again so it’s the same random
numbers but it’s still a random number so every time I use this number five
years from now if I use twenty three four five four and then I run index I
should give the same number so let’s run that real quick one more time set the</p>
<p>00:08
seed index okay so I have twelve thousand 128 let’s let’s delete this all
of it let’s rerun copa-data kids pulling in the data now let’s run
the set seed again and run an index which get that twelve thousand 128 again
right now it might not seem random because it’s the same number it’s the
same random it’s it’s random but it’s random based on this seed so somebody
can reproduce this random number hope that makes sense because again you want
to reproduce it if if if you’re having a
problem with the data and they can’t get the exact same set of rows that you’re
talking about there might be some weird problem where that mattered
so that’s why it’s it’s random yet we can reproduce that randomness that’s
what that’s what I’m talking about now so now that we have that index let’s go
down to Cove and sub let’s do this more more properly so copa-data
and what do we want for ROS I want whatever ROS the index was I want those</p>
<p>00:09
three rows so I’m gonna pull just those rows and every call on the blank so
brancovis sub and then now I’m gonna replace my Cobra data again only because
only because all the Cova data variables below it are using Cova data so I want
somebody to be able to reproduce all of that other code so I’m going to use
watch my kovat data right here change to three observations when I reapply this
structure and create a data frame from it main enter and now I have three
observations of two variables coded data so you’d want to paste this in and then
whatever’s below it because anybody with this code it’s text this is a text that
you know paste in a stack overflow you paste that in and you’re good to go
and that’s it so again if you guys enjoy these tutorials please help me by share
and like in if you have any questions comment below I try to answer them I</p>
<p>00:10
will see you guys on the next one you [Music]End of file</p>
