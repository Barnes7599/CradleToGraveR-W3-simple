I want to show you how to create these visual plots that actually animate
usually through time or through some sort of state things like that you’re
gonna see a lot of these popping up because it’s very popular now now I’m
not going to show you how this all works I just want to show you how to get the
first one to actually render and actually plot so that it moves like that
if you have a MacBook Pro like I do you’re in a Mac operating system you
might run into this problem and Here I am to solve that problem for you
hopefully so let me start off with where
I started learning how to do these plots I literally didn’t get very far so I’m
on this website now and I’ll have the link to it in the description but I’m on
this website and I’m reading and I’m following along and immediately I
thought okay going down going down here’s a static plot and then it says</p>
<p>00:01
hey to animate it just add this transition time right here and you can
animate it well as soon as I did that I ran into some problems and some errors
now I can’t reproduce the error because I’ve already solved the problem but let
me tell you what the error is and if you have the same type of error you can
probably fix it this might be a Mac only thing so let me go to this warning that
I found when I started googling what my error message was my message was file a
renderer failed to copy frames to the destination directory and I’m like
what’s going on stuff I start Google and I start Stack Overflow and everyone
keeps saying oh it’s here permissions you have something wrong with your
permissions but I mean I can write things to my folder no problem here’s my
files here right I’m writing all these different little PNG files no problem
but it never animates so what happens is
somehow there’s a function in there or a
call to some API for my Mac OS that says
to write something to this folder that I think is not coming directly from our</p>
<p>00:02
I’m not a hundred cents sure anyway so to solve the problem the answer was not
on this site right so other people have had this problem and the answer was not
on this site completely it did say your permissions are wrong so what I did was
I said okay what’s my working directory so let’s do
get WD and I said alright desktop animation examples so what I did was I
went to the finder I went to my desktop clicked on animation examples and I
thought oh well fix I’ll just make it so it’s right and read a bowl from every
program so I right click or double click with your finger
I go down to get info this is my normal way I would I would think to do it and
now I look at it and down here at the bottom if it’s not showing you can click
on this little arrow sharing and permissions it says read and write from
me and then staff read only and everyone read only now I’ve tried to change this
multiple times within this window for example the first thing I started doing</p>
<p>00:03
was clicking on it and go to read right click on it go to read write and I
thought I was good to go well that didn’t work
it kept reverting back to read-only so then I decided let me click this little
lock thing then it asks for my password I put in my fingerprint put in your
password and then I thought ok now it’s good well that didn’t work either
so then I clicked on this little Settings icon and I said apply to
enclosed items and then it asked me are you sure you want to do that I say yes
now it says read and write read and write read and write here right and
that’s not probably the probably the most secure thing to do but this is my
workaround to just get this thing to work once I’ve closed it out I try to
run the program again and it does not work so let’s go back and check to get
info again right now it says read and write read and write read and write but
then as soon as I ran the program again it would give me the same error so I
want to show you a different way to change the permissions on that folder so
the other way to do it if that doesn’t work which it did not work for me
literally like 5 or 6 times I was playing around with it so go to your</p>
<p>00:04
terminal which is down here and I’m sorry for the fun I’ll zoom in as much
as I can but what you want to do is you want to go into you can click LS and
usually if you do LS let me go back one if you do LS you’re probably going to
start in this type of directory where you can see your applications documents
library desktop so you want to go into wherever your folder is located so I’m
hoping that you know how to locate your own folder my nose under the desktop so
I see the desktop I did a LS and I know that my folder was
called animation examples so and you can see that animation examples so I did a
change mode a CH mod-2 change permission CH mo d and just because I’m a little
bit careless when it comes to this permission stuff I do 777 which is
readwrite access for everybody and everything every program can read read
access and then I type in space and I put in the actual directory which is</p>
<p>00:05
animated examples I hit enter and then it should work you can do LS dash L LS
space dash L and you can see animation examples at the bottom and you can see
down here the D rwx and all that you know you need something like that and
then you know you have permissions I literally had to go through that in
order to get my permissions to work however this still did not work I had to
install a couple more packages so be wary of that as well the other packages
that I had to install one was called gif
skee gif sk i and then finally I do also install PNG PNG like a PNG file install
those to change those permissions like I
said and then you can run this I’m gonna come and run this thing now and you
should see down here it’ll render now when I was having the errors it would
render it just wouldn’t show me any plots it would give me lines of warnings
especially the warning that said can’t write this file but now you should be
able to get the plot and you can do this in an RM d file a notebook file you can</p>
<p>00:06
render the notebook file and the HTML output will actually still a render and
so let me just go back to this site here
where I was learning from here so I made it this far and I haven’t learned the
inner the inner workings of this function you have this library but this
warning message failed file a renderer failed to copy frames to the destination
as I scrolled down into the the comments
I noticed somebody else had this problem down here towards the bottom somewhere
anyways somebody else had this problem so I’m
gonna go try to copy this link and show them how I fixed it hopefully this helps
you and then there you can change the parameters
change the data try to play around with it instead of this transition time you
can do transition state or transition reveal there’s all kinds I’ll send you a
link to this particular site where I was going to learn how to do this but I ran
into these snags if you run into those snags hopefully this will help you fix it</p>
<p>00:07
again I’m on a Mac OS running not the latest operating system I’m running
let’s see demo javi all right well if you found this tutorial interesting
please share comment and like and share this videoEnd of file</p>
