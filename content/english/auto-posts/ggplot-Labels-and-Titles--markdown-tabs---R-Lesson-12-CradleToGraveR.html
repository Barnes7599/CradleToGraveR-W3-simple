let’s start up again with some more GG plots last time we left off with the IRS
data set being plotted here on the bottom right hand side you can see that
you can kind of cluster it maybe with all the red dots and you can see the
green and blue are kind of mixed together and as a legend and you can see
the x-axis and the y-axis have labels but let’s modify those labels to be a
little bit more aesthetically pleasing so and that being said let’s start from
scratch so that we can all be in the same page we’re gonna do a new we’ll do
an our notebook and we will just clear all this out remember how to insert a
chunk command option I for insert and now we have an R chunk ready to go we’ll
put a header in there saying we’re gonna do a scatterplot scatterplot 1 and I’m
gonna show you a little trick with us our markdown as well that I didn’t show</p>
<p>00:01
you in the previous lessons let’s get started by first doing a quick view of
the iris dataset once again I’m just in do command enter on that and we have
sepal length with petal length petal width and the species so the first four
features are numerix they’re basically decimal numbers or doubles and then the
species is what we call a factor or a categorical variable now heaven like a
species called satola versus verse c color whatever these species are there’s
not one that’s better than the other so just be careful when you deal with
factors that if there’s no true order to them that matters I mean and it doesn’t
matter it depends on the situation but in this case the species has no order so
Tosa is not any greater than mercy color and and that’s not any greater than
virginica right so there’s no order involved so these are factors let’s
close this out we’re not going to really</p>
<p>00:02
view it we want to plot this remember we did we did library ggplot2
we load that in fact what we should do is probably load the libraries in one
section here and say load libraries and whatever libraries we’re going to
use we’ll put right here and we can hit the play button now it’s loaded in our
memory we can use it now let’s talk about the first plot so we’ll say this
is going to be a scatter plot and command option I we get another R chunk
alright so now let’s do a quick plot review plot and we’re going to plot the
iris dataset remember if I hit command enter on this now
it’s going to be a blank slate now because I’m in an R markdown and I’m in
a notebook you see that the plot is actually within line in line with my
notebook file here it’s not over here where the plots are alright so we can
make that a little bit smaller so you can view it better now we don’t want</p>
<p>00:03
just a blanks blank spot with one an aesthetic so AES remember is the
aesthetic for the second parameter in ggplot and we’ll set an x equals and a y
equals so x equals what oh I forget what they’re called sepal in simple with
whatever or maybe a CPA see it doesn’t autofill right now so instead of doing
that I’m gonna just go ahead and type in Pyrus dollar sign and then I have my
list right here so let’s just plot the length versus the let’s do sepal length
and petal dot length just for fun alright so that’s my X I’m gonna make my
Y is equal to the petal length okay we have that there
and we’ll close that off with another paren see and let’s run this and see
what we have alright so again we’re back where we
were we have a grid we have x-axis and a y-axis we have some grids with some
actual tick marks on there five six seven eight and two four six all right</p>
<p>00:04
so we’re missing the actual plot itself because we never told this to we said
hey we’re gonna get ready for a plot but I never said what to plot or what type
of plot so just like math we’ll just do a plus sign and I’m gonna add some space
here and I’m going to type in the GR point that’s the scatter plot and once I
hit the play button on that we finally have our plot and now remember in our
aesthetics we can actually add a color as well if we chose so comma we can do
color equals so we’re going to set the color equal to
that species the categorical or the factor so that’s going to be the iris
species now when we hit the run button we have those colors and here we are now
what I want to show you is that you can store these plots as just like anything
else another variable so I’m going to call this my scatter plot right set that</p>
<p>00:05
equal to all of that and you see nothing happens because all I did was say hey
make this plot don’t display it but store it into the variable called my
scatter plot now how do we display it it depends but most likely you can just
type in my scatter plot and have it run within this chunk if not I’ll show you a
different method I’ll show you both methods just in case so there it is it
runs you can actually put in a print function as well and this might be a
safer bet not too sure and it does the same thing so if you do run into
problems just remember that you can print the plot as well but now that I
have this I can use this scatter plot for anything I want I don’t have to
retype all of this every single time I want to create this plot pretty cool now
what do we want to do with my scatter plot I want to change the x and y axes
labels and I want to put a title on there okay so that’s got a plot one
we’ll call the scatter plot no title just for fun because I want to show you</p>
<p>00:06
something else here now remember when you save your markdown file it creates
an HTML file let’s go ahead and save it now command s and I’m gonna save this as
scatter plots it doesn’t matter save it I’m going to go over to my files over
here and you will see hopefully roof down at the bottom I have scatter plots
to RMD in scatter plots 10b dot HTML let’s open up that HTML file open in a
web browser and I’ll bring it over for you to see here and we have a cool
transparent all the coats there notebook
file reproducible why is it reproducible I can take anybody that has our and say
hey click on this code and say download my arm D file
that’s powerful you can hide all the code if you want to show management just
a plot you can you can show all the code
you can actually set all these of course throughout your notebook file RMD file
let’s close this out and what I wanted to show you is something cool
instead of doing load libraries and scatter plots in this in this manner</p>
<p>00:07
when I locate that let’s add tabs I never showed you tabs so what I can do
is I can create a tab let’s do one header and say plots and I’m gonna put
Open bracket and I’m gonna type in dot tab set so what that means is anything
that’s a greater level indentation than the one hash tag like the two it’s gonna
create itself a tag or a tab and until I go back to the one header the one I
don’t know what the term is it’ll continue to create tabs I’ll show
you what I mean it’ll make more sense so
for example this one here let’s say that command S and automatically should in
fact you can run it all as well run all just to be sure that everything’s run I
saved it command s you don’t run into any problems click on your notebook file
again open in web browser and again I’ll bring it over and you’re not gonna see</p>
<p>00:08
the tab so much because there’s only one you can see the tab but there’s no link
to click right so it’s under scatterplot and no title that’s what this is under
now you really notice it in fact we can keep this open let me go ahead and add
another second level head in OOP I clicked it so let’s go below this one
and do a second level head in and call this scatterplot with title and remember
we do command option I and remember we saved that scatterplot as my scatterplot
so we can reuse this we can reuse this that’s what’s cool about it so we’re
gonna take that and we’re gonna add something to it what are we gonna add
we’re gonna add labels so when I just call it L abs and you can see in the
yellow information bar there it says title subtitle caption etc etc</p>
<p>00:09
so let’s go ahead and just type in title equals and just say my scatterplot I’m
gonna run that make sure it runs and you
can see it has a little title at the top and I’m gonna save it but what I really
want to show you too is once it’s saved let’s go back to that that notebook file
which is right here I’ll refresh it and you see I have
multiple tabs so that’s pretty cool you can have multiple tabs anywhere you want
in your markdown let’s go back over here and I’ll show you how to get that down
to a another level as you just go back and you start a level one head in and
say new stuff here and then we can do we can talk about it I can add an arch UNK
and what I can do is under new stuff I can also make more tabs dot tab set
don’t forget and then now any second level header so second level header will</p>
<p>00:10
have will be a new tab the new tab again and I’m just giving you the idea here
yeah that must be my Boston coming out idea idea too we saved this we sent it
to our boss we click on the file again open in web browser and here we go we
have multiple tabs for this top one scroll down and we have new stuff with
multiple tabs here in fact you can have tabs within tabs within tabs you can
continue to do this I’m not sure how many levels I think it’s something maybe
six but I could be wrong so you get the idea that’s how we want to do our tab
sets have fun with the tabs playing around with them and let’s go back up
let’s clean this mess up here I was playing around with second and third
level tabs we don’t really need those at
the moment so so cool we have our second tab with the my scatterplot label let’s</p>
<p>00:11
go ahead and create a third tab and we’ll do that with second level header
and say scatterplot with title and axes labels
and I’m not gonna get into all the different things you can do here because
as we go throughout these tutorials we’ll add more or less subtract more
you’re going to start googling this stuff Stack Overflow in it you’re going
to find some really cool ways to twist and turn the text make it centered and I
will get through some of that as we go but I just I wanted to give you a taste
of it here alright so what did we do here we have my scatterplot plus we
added the labels we didn’t save it as anything but we could have but I’m not
going to I’m gonna go ahead and ctrl C on my Mac scatterplot and let’s let’s do
the title again but this time we’re gonna add the labels was it leaves L abs
and we’re gonna say title equals my title but this time we will add the axes</p>
<p>00:12
as well so x equals C pull space length y equals petal length all right let’s
run that make sure it works Oh hit the wrong button I don’t even know
what that button does run all chunks above okay
cool that works so there it is we have our awesome prettier looking more
aesthetically pleasing X and y axis with the title now let’s save that with ctrl
s check out our last final notebook file here so we have our plots all in
different tabs it’s just one way more one other way to present this to your
colleagues you management and don’t forget all the code can be hidden you
can download the entire arm D file and open it up and don’t forget iris comes
with it so anybody should be able to run this if you’re doing it with a CSV file
that is not from the iris or not from the standard data sets that come with</p>
<p>00:13
our in our studio then you have to provide them with that as well the
actual CSV file because this will not contain it that’s it for this one we’ll
keep it short the next one I’m going to show you how to incorporate some bar
graphs different types of charts maybe some box plots things like that so stay
tuned stick aroundEnd of file</p>
