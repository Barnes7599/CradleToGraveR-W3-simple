today we’re going to learn about plotting so let’s go to packages and
install a package and we’re going to type in ggplot2 and we’re going to get
that from the crown library if you haven’t already installed it go ahead
and install that and what ggplot is it’s a very elegant and aesthetically
pleasing way to graph all kinds of plots and a lot of people refer to it as the
grammar of graphics because you can basically do anything with these with
ggplot it’s super powerful and you’re gonna see why here in just a moment so
now that it’s downloaded and installed let’s load the library which is you plot
to and we’re gonna play with a dataset called the diamond data set so let’s
take a look at that first let’s do a view and just type in diamond Oh</p>
<p>00:01
diamonds okay so here we have the caret the cut color clarity is etc etc and we
have a bunch of data on here I’m gonna look at mostly maybe price and the carat
just whatever we really feel like doing it we’re going to play around with this
stuff so I’m not sure what all this stuff means again how do you find more
data about it you can do question mark and then type in diamonds because
diamonds is another one of those data sets that comes with it so here we go
here’s all the description of the data set
looks like fifty three thousand rows and ten variables cool how else could we
have done that we could have done I mentioned Jim there we go fifty-three
thousand nine hundred forty by ten cool alright let’s play with ggplot so the
first thing you want to do is you want to bring in a data frame diamonds data
frame again when I’m going to be late in
this we’re not gonna change it so we can we don’t have to store it in our RAM in</p>
<p>00:02
our environment our environment is empty because we’re just gonna hit command
editor on this and you’re gonna see that nothing happens so it’s it’s a function
called ggplot as you can see over here on the right hand side where it says
plots it’s just a blank slate so we’ve we’ve told you do plots hey get ready
we’re gonna use you but we do do anything with it so what we have to
do is we have to set up this plot and get get it ready get it going
we need to supply some more information so let’s put some aesthetics on it so
inside of the parameter of Juji plot the second parameter here we could put an
aesthetic AES and as you can see here it says aesthetic mappings describe how
variables in the data are mapped to visual properties aesthetics of geum’s
jia mystic a layer like what geometry is at a point at a bar graph what is it
let’s start off with just doing something simple here and saying X is
equal to the caret because that was one of the features and we’ll say Y is equal</p>
<p>00:03
to the price and now let’s hit enter as you can see nothing plots but we did get
a couple things here we’ve got a grid we’ve got carat across the x-axis is 0
through 5 and we have price along the y axis or the vertical axis so it didn’t
know what the plot because we can tell it what kind of plot so in order to do
that we could add layers or add a geometry so we can add just like math we
can hit the plus button and I’m gonna put this on the next line because
remember white space doesn’t really matter so much I’m gonna add a we want a
scatterplot so I’m gonna add something called the Jian GE OM underscore point
and just like that open and close parentheses and we’re gonna hit command
enter on that and now let’s see if we get an actual plot now there’s 53,000
rows here we go so we said X is 2 carat and y is the</p>
<p>00:04
price and we have a scatter plot pretty ugly let’s just say that so let’s add
another aesthetic let’s add an aesthetic called color and will will relate the
color to something called the cut if you remember let’s go back and view this
view diamonds the cut is either ideal premium good very good
so aced on the cut let’s see if there’s any any places within this scatterplot
that a certain cut might be you say more expensive than another cut let’s just
try that out so in order to do that we have aesthetics that says x equals caret
y equals price but there’s also one called color we can add we say color is
equal to and cut and if you’re not sure what the features are you can always do
diamonds and then hit the dollar sign and then do cut and it should do the</p>
<p>00:05
same thing it’s just a little Messier when you’re typing it all out here we go
we’ve got some cool plot here let’s zoom
in and take a better look here we go and it obviously comes with a legend over
here fair good very good ideal so we have carat price and it doesn’t really
look like this a lot of correlation that I can see maybe maybe the yellows are a
little bit to the left and upper part I’m not sure doesn’t know I can’t see
anything in there so that’s the idea between I plot in so we can plot various
things X doesn’t have to be carried and Y doesn’t have to be priced but if you
look at it again let’s view this again both care in price to both numerix so we
have carry and price we also have XY and Z which I’m sure has to do something
with the cut we have table we have depth
let’s do color actual color as a feature and see if we get anything good out of</p>
<p>00:06
that so instead of the color actually be
in the cut we’re going to make the color the actual color feature and see if
anything pops up and notice that color is a move that looks pretty cool it’s a
factor it’s not a digit it’s a categorical variable what I meant to say
so there we go and that’s how you do a basic plot now it’s rerender and every
time I change the size here so it does take just a moment to re-render
and now you can see some pretty cool things here
it looks like the darker blues are always on the top left some yellows are
kind of you know they’re all kind of in line sort of almost like a a curve can
fit that almost and we’ll get into curve fit in here in the next lesson let’s
pick a different data set remember we learned about the iris data set so let’s</p>
<p>00:07
let’s plot the iris data set so remember if you just plot like this could you
plot it says hey get ready here’s a blank slate but I’m not gonna do
anything with it by the way your aesthetics does not have to be within
your ggplot function you can actually add that into your geometry function so
another geometry we wanted to do geom we want to do another scatter plot jam
point let’s put our aesthetics inside of there x equals and I’m not sure what we
have for choices here but we’ll do let’s do sepal length for X comma we’ll do y
is equal to remember you could type an iris a dollar sign to get the things
here let’s see if lengthen width have any correlation or draws something cool
this is just gonna be black and white oh it looks like a bunch of just scatter
plot that’s one of this and let’s just go ahead and add a color for fun so
color equals and then do this and let’s make the color the actual species</p>
<p>00:08
because that’s most likely a categorical variable obviously and here we go
there we go so now what do we see here we’ve got some sort of cluster in here
all that’s red and then you have this little outlier red one here you’ve got
the green and blue a little bit mixed up so pretty cool and so the species type
is on the legend here and we have our axes here and the next lesson I’ll show
you how to change some of the axes and make them look more pretty aesthetically
pleasing that’s it play around with that
and I change up the different parameters and there’s many many many tweaks to
this but this will get you started on plot inEnd of file</p>
