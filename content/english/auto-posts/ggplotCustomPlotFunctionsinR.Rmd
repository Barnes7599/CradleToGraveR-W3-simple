in the last tutorial we learned how to make some more elaborate base our plots
we added a bunch of parameters to our plot function now we don't want to read
we want to reuse this plot function but we don't want to keep copy and paste in
all of this work with different data so I'm going to show you in this tutorial
how to put this into a function form so that we can reuse it and have different
numbers and it'll work just fine with ease and reusability so let's start off
with the basic function first I want to show you what a function is you've
already been using them throughout these tutorials so I'm gonna do the mean
function I'm gonna take the average of some numbers right so I'm gonna take the
mean of numbers and I will take the average of two three and four and I'm
just gonna do command enter on that and let's break this down and dissect it the
name of the function is called mean and it takes in a parameter now it looks
like there's multiple numbers in here but there's really only one argument or
parameter in here and that is the one vector that contains these three numbers

00:01
so it's one argument went inside of this mean function so let me write this
function structure down for you first so you get the idea so whatever function
name you want to call it so my function we're gonna say my function equals a
function see it's a reserved word it changed colors on you and you got to
have open parentheses close parentheses open bracket close bracket so your
function definition the structure of your function is contained within those
brackets now what do you want to bring into that function I want to bring
certain things in sometimes you don't have to we can do a function that just
prints hello now let's this won't do anything in it
of itself you have to blow this function into memory and then call the function
so let's do that command enter on line 22 and you'll see over on the right hand
side where my functions are it says my function function right so it's loaded
in memory now let's use it so now I can just do I can call my underscore
function open parenthesis close prints too cuz it's a function now you can see

00:02
in my console that says hello pretty simple right
but now let's do a little bit more elaborate let's let's take this to a new
level let's create our own mean function but it only will take the average of
three digits so I'm going to add parameters or argument
in our function so let's say mean 3 is our the name of the function we're going
to call it function open prints 2 close parenthesis I want to bring in numbers
right because I have to use them in my function so I want to bring in I'm going
to call it a B and C you can call it whatever you want open bracket close
bracket simple as that so now we're bringing in those numbers we can use
them so I'm gonna say result is equal to a plus B plus C all divided by 3 right
and I'm not gonna run this yet now let's print the results so we'll just say

00:03
print paste we'll say the average is that average is comma your results so
there we have it now you can paste you can paste you can allow variables and
strings I'll paste it together so prints nicely so let's run this as in I mean
let's load this into memory so go back to win 28 where that is hit command hit
the command enter button no errors which is good now you see up in my functions
area I mean underscore 3 function ABC let's use that real quick so now I'm
going to say mean 3 open paren see now you can see the pop-up it says a B and C
right there it tells us gives us a hint
so let's put in 2 3 &amp; 4 we should get
the same result as before the average is 3 so the average is 3 that worked we
could try different numbers it doesn't matter it should always work so we're
really making reusable pieces of our code here so now thinking about all that
let's go back to our plot and see if we can make that into a function instead so
that we can plot multiple things before we do that there is something called

00:04
default arguments in your functions you'll see up here and mean 3 I have a B
and C here now if you didn't always want to have the third argument in there now
this this example is not going to make sense you're gonna actually it'll make
sense let's say that you always had this is an example
you always have either 5 in your set of numbers or some other number but if the
5 is not there it's automatically put there so let's say let's put
see is we're gonna say C is equal to five now we're gonna rerun this function
we can't if I run this now you get the same result because I didn't reload the
function into memory so take that into consideration so command enter now still
no errors mice equals five that's true but now when I call mean three you're
gonna see two five and four that four will override the C so C does equal five
if it's not explicitly stated but it is it's saying make that CF four so you're
gonna still get the same result once again now if I got rid of that four and

00:05
you do it with just the two parameters you get a different average right
because it automatically put the five in there so that's a default argument to
your function I think you kind of get the idea there you can default them all
to whatever you choose you can override them but be careful that if you default
say the first one like the a but you don't default the second one a third one
and you only put in one parameter it's going to confuse the system at the
program it doesn't know which one you're trying to assign it to so just be
careful on the number of parameters and the orders and things like that we'll
talk more in later episodes but we've got this figured out functions are cool
now let's go back up if you haven't caught up with me from the last tutorial
we created a Fibonacci series the first six or seven digits and we wanted to
plot them so let's go ahead and do that again you can pause this video and write
this code down to catch up if you don't have it so I'm gonna command enter on
the FIB we've got the fib vector loaded now let's plot that Fibonacci series

00:06
once again command enter we've got this cool looking plot that's ridiculously
sized and whatnot but who cares so we want to reuse this for other things
besides fib and I don't want to cut and paste like what if I had a different set
of numbers called another sequence seq one and we'll just make this one
arbitrary whatever numbers you want to use and a different number of numbers
you know it doesn't hack this him it's anything you want to plot it could be a
column of numbers from your excel file or your sheet so command enter on that
you'll see that I can I can now change fib to
sequence one command enter and now look at this cool little plot it's not called
Fibonacci series but we can we can change that that's what we're about to
do let's do that so we're gonna create a plot function
that plots a title and a set of data and so we get to do that so let's think

00:07
about this plot as a function instead of a plot so in fact we want to plot
something so let's just encapsulate and close this plot function within a
function of our own that's actually called composition by the way when you
have functions within functions which is perfectly valid
that's called composition so we're gonna call this my plot and I'm going to open
closed parentheses oh no I'm sorry I'm going to say my plot function is
equal to and now we're gonna define the word defined function how many
parameters we want to bring in there well we said we want to bring in some
data so let's call it my data we're gonna bring in some data so the sequence
1 or the Fibonacci series or whatever data you want to bring in and I said we
want to change the title so let's change the title so let's call it my title you
can call it whatever you want now open bracket close bracket right now this
time I want to encapsulate that plot though so let's go ahead and delete that
second close bracket bring it way down here after the plot now now you've
encapsulated that now you might want to also tab this out this is typically what

00:08
you do in programming is you will use white space and hit the tab button and
bring it up a little bit so you know you
can kind of see I have my fonts a little high so that you guys can see it better
on the screen but you can see how between that bracket and my plot you can
really see what's enclosed inside of that function now if I do this here
we're still in trouble because we didn't
replace sequence 1 with my data so let's do that because right now if I run this
function in fact let's do that just to give you a little taste of it you should
get no errors ran it no errors we called it my plot now if I let's delete this
here just so you know it's not the same one we're gonna call I'll call it down
here I'll call it my plot my underscore with no oh it's got two arguments I can
put the two arguments in there I'll put in say the number two and a vector and a
title my title and you'll see that nothing is really gonna change when I
run this it still says if Evan actually series and still has that data well

00:09
that's because we didn't replace it with these two parameters that we are trying
to bring in so sequence one we don't want sequence one we want my data and we
don't want this title we want my title let's reuse and make this more versatile
my title okay now with the reload this function into memory command and enter ah
error let's see what the error is my data not found I do this all the time
you need to go to line four and hit enter to reload the whole function you
can actually run pieces of the function inside of if I click on line ten and I
hit enter you know that's why I got the error we loaded into memory now now if I
go back or now if I want to actually call this function I can say my plot fea
tab see it automatically thanks to our studio automatically gives you the
functions that you've created in a list form so my plot I want to bring in data
and title what data let's bring in the sequence one data that we have above and

00:10
I'm going to call it sequence one command enter on that now you see on the
on the plot we have sequence one and it's got the data oh we can also do fib
there we go we have sequence one with fib we can
call it whatever you want and that's how you can reuse plots very simply so
create the most beautiful aesthetically pleasing plot you want and then
encapsulate it into a function and you can reuse it all day long and of course
you're gonna bring in more parameters and set more values if you don't want to
but the idea is you get a lot of these attributes set the way you like so that
you don't have to keep bringing in all that data every time you want to plot
something minimal use I like this one because it's got two arguments only so
once we make this as pretty and aesthetically pleasing as we like with
all of our phonce our sizes the look and feel make
it into a function and reuse it so my goal is to grow this channel into a

00:11
monetize channel I'm not even close but that is a goal so if you share and
subscribe and let the world know that I exist please do so and I'll continue
these these tutorials Thanks [Music]End of file
