hey just a quick note throughout your career you’re gonna be using data and
you’re gonna be using all kinds of packages out there it’s nice to know
that when you’re using our and our packages they’re freely available and
you can pretty much reproduce this anytime and anywhere with any company at
no cost so I just wanted to throw that out there before we get into this lesson
and what we’re gonna show in this particular lesson by we I mean me is the
gap finder dataset and just a quick tidbit on how to visualize it using
ggplot2 we’ve done some work with the GG plot and applier package so let’s
continue that and we’ll work with a really rough looking graph and turn it
into something more aesthetically pleasing and usable so that being said
get your first r script open and let’s install the gap finder o gap minder gap</p>
<p>00:01
minder let’s start with the right terminology here so Gapminder click on
install it’ll take just a second to install I already have it installed but
I I clicked it again just to show you and then of course if you don’t have the
DES plier package DP Lyr or go ahead and
do that as well TP ly r so at that point
install the plier and let’s go ahead and load those two libraries so library D
plier and run that and library gap minder now before we do anything with
plot and let’s just take a quick look at the data see what we’re dealing with at
a very broad view so let’s just go ahead and pipe the Gapminder data into
remember command command shift M command into capital V aw view and run that now
you can see on my screen I have country data continent year life expectancy</p>
<p>00:02
population and GDP percentage so and there’s a 1,700 1,700 for entries so
that’s the data we’re dealing with finally before we start plotting we’re
gonna use you plot like I said so let’s go ahead and install ggplot2 if you
haven’t already so that’s the third package we’re gonna want to
install and of course we’ll put it up here in our library and type in ggplot
to put a little gap in there for aesthetics and now we can use the ggplot
functions all right so we want to plot this and see what kind of data we can
get but we’re also going to do some deep liar within our plots so we’re gonna
reduce the amount of data that we’re gonna look at so let’s go ahead and
start with the actual data set so Gapminder data set want to pipe that
into a filter so let’s filter out some data we want to filter by GDP for
example let’s let’s actually go back and</p>
<p>00:03
view the data so I can go back and forth so Gapminder piped into the viewer
let’s get that running so you can see GDP percent capita so it’s a gross
domestic product per capita is is what that stands for let’s go ahead and try
to filter out some of these based on some criteria random criteria so I’m
going to keep that open what we’ll do is we’ll pipe this into a filter and then
the filter will say GDP per capita let’s only do what’s less than say 40,000
right and then we’re gonna pipe that into something else what we’re gonna
pipe it into we’re gonna pipe it into the actual ggplot function so do plot
and inside of this plot we have to have an aesthetic we have to tell ggplot what
to apply to the x and y axis basically so we want our a a es our aesthetic to
be mapped we want the X to be mapped to GDP percent capita then we’ll have the Y</p>
<p>00:04
access map to say life expectancy so life expectancy I’m hitting the tab key
to auto-complete because it knows based on the on the data that I piped in it
knows that I’m using those variables or those features so now we have an
aesthetic cool but we still need to have a layer so we have an external y-axis
but we don’t tell it what type of plot do you want so let’s add so ggplot is a
grammar of graphics so we’re gonna add just like the piper operator we’re going
to use the plus sign instead we’re going to add a geometry called GM
and from there we hit the command ninja button if all goes well you have a plot
that looks like this on the bottom right hand side of my screen it’s a little
busy a little crazy but that’s how you get started so now the beauty of using
ggplot is with just minor modifications you can make this plot a lot more
appealing so we’re going to walk through those next the first quick example to
liven this up is we’re gonna add a legend and with continents we want to
figure out hey which continents are these countries from so inside of our</p>
<p>00:05
aesthetic we mapped remember we map the x and y now let’s map a color so when I
say color is equal to and that’s gonna be the continent and so here we go let’s
run this you’ll see the colors change in a little bit I’ll even I’m gonna leave
this not zoomed in so that I can program the actual Final Cut Pro edit a lot
easier as you can see here though is we have Africa Americas Asia we have the
continents and you can see that life expectancy of Europe the blue as your
GDP goes up your life expectancy seems to go up so there’s a correlation
possibly right so that’s what we’re looking for things like that so let’s go
a little bit further then if you find this video helpful you can help me back
by sharing the video on social media liking and subscribing by sharing the
video it’ll help expand my audience and grow this channel which will motivate me
to do more tutorials I’d love to do more but I need your help so just go ahead</p>
<p>00:06
and share the video and that’ll definitely make my day thank you so it
is a little less busy well it’s still busy but you can kind of see some
differences between the continents now but there’s a lot of overlap so let’s
get rid of that both so just think about
what you’re trying to do to this overall
picture we have an X we have a Y we have color codes we have we want to change
something let’s change the actual dots themselves so where the dots will the
dots are the Gion points so inside of Gyan point we can put an alpha value
alpha equals and we can set that to say point I’ll try point to hit command
enter and you’ll see now it basically depends on how much density
how dense those points are well amongst the other points it’ll actually make
some of them transparent but I’ll point to does look a little bit too
transparent so let’s try 0.35 and just go from there fiddle around with the try</p>
<p>00:07
it so now you can kind of see where the overlaps are but that’s still a little
bit mmm clutter clustered or cluttered it’s a little bit cluttered let’s fix
that so we messed with the colors to give us the actual countenance but what
about if we want to compare like the sizes of the actual concentrations of
population right so again we have this data in here we have population as a
variable now you don’t have to use population but I want to see the
population differences so instead of aesthetically mapping the XY and the
color color to continent we can actually add another parameter in there called
size and we set that equal to population
and you’ll see various size dots now one
thing that you want to also note is that I swapped the parameters and it’s fine
because I explicitly said size equals population columns equals continent now
if I didn’t and I just typed in continent without any Co l equals then</p>
<p>00:08
you would have some issues there as well now we can kind of maybe possibly put a
line that goes across this so let’s add another layer of geometry called P I’m
smooth and what that’ll do is it’ll put a best guess linear not linear but a
line you can see the lines now kind of a trend line you can see what’s going on
with this particular continent it’s based on continent any of your
population legend down here as well which I didn’t even notice before but
that’s not very helpful it’s a it’s not aesthetically pleasing to the eye now a
lot of people are not going to be able to understand the equations involved
with these sophisticated smooth geometries so let’s make that a linear
model so as if it was just a straight line so we can add a method inside of
this camp smooth and we can set that equal to LM linear model now of course
this is going to be it’s not the best linear</p>
<p>00:09
model because the data is so skewed so let’s try to clean up that data just a
little bit now I’m not going to get into the statistics too much but if you do a
log transform so just take the log of the GDP percent capital inside of where
the X mapped is X aesthetic is mapped to the plot let’s run that one more time
and it’s going to regenerate everything now you can see some more straight lines
which is good so there you have it that’s a really good way to get started
with creating geometries and ggplot graphics but let’s take it one step
further because you know what to me this is still cluttered so finally what I
want to do is I want to break out this this plot into different facets so we’re
gonna use facet wrap so + facet and you’ve probably seen this before that’s
a trap and we want to base it off of this is a shortcut we can use this
little tilde to say base it off of what let’s let’s base it off the continent</p>
<p>00:10
typically cont I and ent I don’t know why I have the worst time spelling there
and there we have it we have every continent split out with a geometry that
tells you what the linear model would be based on this log transformation of the
GDP percent capita now if you don’t want to mess with a lot of transferrin trans
transformation you can get rid of it but
again I’m gonna show you the picture and it’s the linear model will not fit it
very smooth you can see how it’s just see that big cluster at the very
beginning the data is very skewed so that’s why we did that now if I kept the
method equals out of there then we can have a better line so depends on what
you’re going for but this is a quick way to explore some geometries with ggplot
some layers some facet wrap and various parameters and attributes so so there
you have it then from there you can export this if you’d like you can export</p>
<p>00:11
it as an image or a PDF file copy it to my clipboard paste it in your favorite
program but ultimately eventually you want to automate everything so we don’t
want to use the mouse we’re gonna grammatically do all that as these
future tutorials go on I hope to have all of that for you so stick stick
around and stay tuned [Music]End of file</p>
